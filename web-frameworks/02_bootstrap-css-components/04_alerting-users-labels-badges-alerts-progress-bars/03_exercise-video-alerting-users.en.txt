Our next exercise, which is going
to be a very short exercise, is going to look at various
ways of alerting users. We have already seen that we have labels,
badges, alerts and progress bars to inform the user. In this exercise,
we're going to examine labels and badges. Alerts will be explored further
in the assignment that follows. Progress bars are a bit difficult
to illustrate at this moment because we don't have any dynamic
behavior on our website yet. That requires some server-side support. So we'll come back to
examine progress bars in more detail in some
of the later courses. Getting back to our webpage,
in the index.html page we see that we are displaying a dish on the page here. Now, I'm going to add a label and
a badge to this dish name. Thereby, explore the use of labels and
badges. Moving to our HTML code. Right next to the name of the dish,
I'm going to add a label. So I have added the label
using the span tag. With the class label, label-danger and label-xs with the letters
Hot inside the span. So this should display a label
right next to the name of the dish with Hot in there,
in red color. Going back to the webpage, you can now notice that there is a label
right next to the name of the dish. In the next step, I'm going to add
a badge, right next to the label. Here I am using the span with the class,
badge. And then I am adding a price of the dish,
right next to the label there. So you can see in the code how I
have added the badge into place. Now looking at the result of adding
this you will notice on the website that right next to the label you now have the
price of the dish being displayed there. Now I have leveraged the badge class in order to display
the price of the dish here. Now the badge class is a lot
more versatile than that. We'll explore more about using badges when
we have dynamic behavior on our website. This completes this exercise. In this short exercise we
examined labels and badges. We'll look at alerts and
progress bars later.
