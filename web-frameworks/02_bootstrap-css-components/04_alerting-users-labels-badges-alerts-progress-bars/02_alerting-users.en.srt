00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,500
Many a times, you may wish to draw
the attention of visitors to your website,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,585
to certain parts of your website.

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:11,650
Or maybe you may want to
deliver a message to users.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,350
This is where the radius, available

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,560
mechanisms to deliver alerts to users,
becomes very, very valuable.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,610
So in this lecture we will examine
bootstrapped support for alerting users.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,970
We have labels, we have badges,
we have alerts and progress bars.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,090
For simple updates to users labels and
badges may be more than sufficient.

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,510
They just display a small piece of
information within the website.

10
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,950
Say, for example,
display the number of unread e-mails.

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,710
Or maybe an item that is new or
updated at this moment.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,230
These kind of things can easily be
delivered using labels and badges.

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,420
Alerts or error or warning messages
can easily be delivered to users by

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:14,160
highlighting the messages on the website
by surrounding it with appropriate

15
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,480
background so
that it's clearly visible to the users.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,530
Progress bars are a way of indicating
progress of any activity that is going on

17
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,420
on your website, like uploading or
downloading a file for example.

18
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,800
Here is an example of the use of
labels and badges on your website.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,950
Now, to use a label in bootstrap
we will use the span tag and

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,160
then apply the class label and
depending on the color

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,970
that you want your label to be, you would
use label primary info danger and so on.

22
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,510
And you can also specify
the size of the label.

23
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,890
Similarly, badges also use this span tag

24
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,590
with the class badge
applied to the span tag.

25
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,800
So as we have already seen Labels.

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,160
Use the class's label and label-color of

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,850
the label that you want to use,
and also the size.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,580
Badges are fairly straightforward.

29
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,690
There's a single class called badge
that you apply to the span tag, and

30
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,600
then whatever is the contents inside the
span tags will be displayed as a badge.

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,080
The badge will automatically
adapt to where it is displayed.

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,060
So for example if the item for which it
is included is with a darker background,

33
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,380
the badge will be displayed in lighter
color to match the other lettering

34
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,630
within within the parent tech.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,630
Badges are interesting in the sense that
if there is no content within the badge,

36
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,020
the badge just will
automatically collapse.

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,090
So that it won't be visible on the screen.

38
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,930
So that's one easy way of
using badges on your website.

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,050
Alerts are another way of
delivering messages to the user.

40
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,515
An alert will be displayed at the location
indicated within the webpage.

41
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,385
That alert will be
surrounded by a bounding box

42
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:27,095
with a background color that is
determined by the specification.

43
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:30,615
So in this example,
you see me saying alert warning.

44
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:33,835
So that's why the background
color is yellow in color.

45
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:38,575
In addition, within this alert,
I am including the icon

46
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:43,300
the cross icon there which when
clicked will dismiss the alert.

47
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,020
To make this work, of course,
I need to include an icon for

48
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,280
that I am using the button tag.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,290
And inside the button tag I
am applying the close class.

50
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,600
And also the class is
displayed by using the times

51
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,830
icon from HTML and for the alert itself,

52
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,440
I need to apply the alert+dismissible
class for this to work correctly.

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,495
We can also include links within the
messages that we displayed in the alerts,

54
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:22,925
so in this example you see me using
a link being displayed in the alert.

55
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:27,555
So the links are actionable which means
that the user can click on the link

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,840
to perform the appropriate
link action there.

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,460
As you saw in the example,
the alert class is applied to the div.

58
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,620
And inside there you can specify
colors and also include links and

59
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,990
make the alert dismissible by including
the cross button in the alert.

60
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,910
For the dismissible action to work
you need the JavaScript plug-in to be

61
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,710
installed within your webpage.

62
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,350
Finally, we have progress bars.

63
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,040
Progress bars as I mentioned is
a way of indicating progress of

64
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,960
any action that is going on on a website.

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,280
See, uploading a file or
playing some music,

66
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,960
whatever mechanism that you want to
indicate the progress of the action

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,905
would be well shown on the webpage,
using a progress bar.

68
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:29,585
To use a progress bar,
you would use <div class="progress">.

69
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:30,885
And inside the div,

70
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:35,540
you will have an inner div to which
you will apply the progress bar class.

71
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,420
The progress bar can
also takes on the color

72
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,320
representation using one of
the standard colors there.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,510
So that's why in this example you
see me using progress bar danger.

74
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,435
You can also make the progress bar
striped so you can apply the class

75
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,340
progress-bar-striped to make a striped
class, if you don't apply that,

76
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,720
it'll be a solid color.

77
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,100
The width of the progress
bar is indicated by

78
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,640
specifying the style for the progress bar.

79
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,750
So in this case I'm specifying
style="width:80%" so,

80
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,700
that's why in the progress bar,
80% is covered.

81
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,330
We can also include a text

82
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,960
that can be directly displayed
inside the progress bar.

83
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,120
Now whatever we include in the span
with the class sr-only Is meant for

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
screen readers.

85
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,230
So if screen readers are being used,

86
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,370
then that information will
be read out to the user.

87
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,440
We can also include the text directly
in the progress bar, as you see,

88
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,390
using the 80% right in the example there.

89
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:53,290
So, to use progress bars, we apply
the progress class to an outer div and

90
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,400
then inside that we'll have
an inner div that's a progress bar.

91
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,980
Now within the outer progress div you can
have multiple progress bars, if you want.

92
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,950
If you do include multiple progress bars,
then they will be stacked so

93
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,120
you can create stacked
progress bars if required.

94
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,980
And for a progress bar you
can define the color and

95
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,410
also whether it is striped or not.

96
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,440
You can even activate
the animation of the striped

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,440
display by using the active class for
the progress bar.

98
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,370
This completes our discussion on
various ways of alerting users.

99
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,650
We'll now move on to a short exercise,
where we will

100
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,530
look at the use of both labels and
badges on our website.
