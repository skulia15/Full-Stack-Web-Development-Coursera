1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,020
Our next exercise, which is going
to be a very short exercise,

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,850
is going to look at various
ways of alerting users.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,280
We have already seen that we have labels,
badges, alerts and

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,850
progress bars to inform the user.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,939
In this exercise,
we're going to examine labels and badges.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,910
Alerts will be explored further
in the assignment that follows.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,440
Progress bars are a bit difficult
to illustrate at this moment

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,970
because we don't have any dynamic
behavior on our website yet.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,140
That requires some server-side support.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,710
So we'll come back to
examine progress bars

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,520
in more detail in some
of the later courses.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,530
Getting back to our webpage,
in the index.html page we see that we

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,578
are displaying a dish on the page here.

14
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:03,610
Now, I'm going to add a label and
a badge to this dish name.

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,990
Thereby, explore the use of labels and
badges.

16
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,325
Moving to our HTML code.

17
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:17,295
Right next to the name of the dish,
I'm going to add a label.

18
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:22,060
So I have added the label
using the span tag.

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,063
With the class label, label-danger and

20
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:30,690
label-xs with the letters
Hot inside the span.

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,640
So this should display a label
right next to the name

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,100
of the dish with Hot in there,
in red color.

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,020
Going back to the webpage,

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,760
you can now notice that there is a label
right next to the name of the dish.

25
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:54,520
In the next step, I'm going to add
a badge, right next to the label.

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,930
Here I am using the span with the class,
badge.

27
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,050
And then I am adding a price of the dish,
right next to the label there.

28
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,890
So you can see in the code how I
have added the badge into place.

29
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:15,430
Now looking at the result of adding
this you will notice on the website that

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,640
right next to the label you now have the
price of the dish being displayed there.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,670
Now I have leveraged the badge class

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,320
in order to display
the price of the dish here.

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,670
Now the badge class is a lot
more versatile than that.

34
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:38,305
We'll explore more about using badges when
we have dynamic behavior on our website.

35
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,375
This completes this exercise.

36
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:45,005
In this short exercise we
examined labels and badges.

37
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:48,705
We'll look at alerts and
progress bars later.
