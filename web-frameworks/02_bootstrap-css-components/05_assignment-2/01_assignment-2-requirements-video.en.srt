1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,863
Our second assignment involves various

2
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:11,894
modifications to be done
to the index.html file that

3
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:16,940
you had at the end of the last
exercise of this module.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,631
To this page,
you're going to add some fonts,

5
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:29,195
some buttons, and a media object,
and also a label.

6
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:39,470
The current state of the index.html
page is as shown here.

7
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:55,470
There are four tasks to be
completed in this assignment.

8
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,960
The first task is to include a form

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,340
within your nav bar that allow
the users to input their

10
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,460
registration information for
this website and login into the website.

11
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,280
Of course,
you just include the form at this moment,

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,585
it will not work at this moment.

13
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:18,740
The contents of this
form should be like this.

14
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,550
So, explore the nav bar forms in more

15
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:30,670
detail on the Bootstrap side to understand
how you would design something like this.

16
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,730
The second task of your assignment

17
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,612
is to include a button here.

18
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:44,810
This button should be
included in its own div here,

19
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,940
so notice that this is
occupying the left over space

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,550
in this row of this.

21
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,280
Now this button, when you click on it,
it will take you down to a form at

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,830
the bottom, which the users can use to
preserve their table on this restaurant.

23
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,090
When you click on the button It
will take you down to a form,

24
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,080
which is at the bottom of this page.

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,580
Now this form is included as another
row in the content of the webpage here.

26
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,270
Now what does this form contain?

27
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,800
This form contains information
that the users need to submit

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,290
in order to reserve on the website.

29
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,260
So here we have a set of radio
buttons that allow us to

30
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,640
select the number of guests, and then we
have a Date and Time specification here.

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,160
Now, notice in particular
inside the Date and Time

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,290
boxes here, you have the glyphicons for
the date and time included.

33
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,440
Again, read the forms in the Bootstrap

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,240
documentation to understand how you
would put glyphicons inside there.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,890
And of course you have
the action button here.

36
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,750
Which, when clicked should,
of course obviously at this stage,

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,800
this form will not work, but
you should have all these in place.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,500
In the, at the end of this assignment.

39
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,680
Now, another part that you will have
here is an alert being displayed here.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,195
This alert in particular has
a link also embedded in here.

41
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:40,555
And also a cross button embedded in here.

42
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:44,955
Again, study alerts to understand how
you will design this warning alert.

43
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:51,245
This is part of this column
that includes the font.

44
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:58,050
Our final task is to apply
the media object class

45
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,600
to the second row of this page.

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,560
Recall that we applied the media object
class to the first and the third row,

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,150
but we left the second row untied, and

48
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,010
I mentioned that we will do that
as part of the second assignment.

49
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,420
In here I am using a media object.

50
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,180
In particular note that the image
is displayed to the right

51
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:28,030
after content rather than to
the left as we did for the other.

52
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,316
Also this should include a label here

53
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:38,437
with the word New inside the label.

54
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:44,210
This completes your second assignment.

55
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,420
So at the end of this assignment,
your webpage should look like this.

56
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,910
First, it should have a way for
the user to enter the login information.

57
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,700
Second, there should be a button
here that when clicked,

58
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,560
will take the user to a reservation form.

59
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,950
Third, there will be
a reservation form at the bottom,

60
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,780
which includes the selection of
the number of guests and date and time.

61
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,790
And also an alert being displayed there.

62
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,290
Dismissable alert being displayed there.

63
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,440
And then finally, of course,

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,780
the second row being styled
properly using a media object.

65
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,900
The image here Is already provided for

66
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,790
you in the IMG folder that
you downloaded earlier.

67
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:40,740
This image is called the buffet.png.

68
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,740
And the label to be displayed here.
