1
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:09,180
Today imagining a website without any
images and media is very hard to do.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,430
But when you think back about when
websites were first designed,

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,860
they were purely content, text content.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,310
But of course today you can't envision
a YouTube without the videos or

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,840
a Pinterest without the images.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,162
So, images and media add enormous
value to web sites these days.

7
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:40,469
You were expecting me to say that,
weren't you?

8
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,900
Well, not quite.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,420
This is what I was planning to say.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,260
A picture is worth $12 on iStockPhoto.com.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,250
Okay, enough with those corny jokes.

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:00,320
Let's move on to talking about images and
media and how to include them on websites.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,170
Paying a quick visit to your
course website yourself, you can

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,030
now begin to look for images and media
that are already included in this website.

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,980
Now, you can easily see that we have
a logo up there, which obviously didn't

16
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,660
get there without an image being
included into the website design.

17
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,540
And obviously you see those pictures
there, images all over again.

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,850
Go into your course content and
there you have, video on your website.

19
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:44,800
So, anywhere you turn you
can't run away from images and

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,290
media and their use on websites.

21
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,460
Let's now talk in particular about
Bootstraps classes to support images.

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,080
Now when you include
images on your website,

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,210
you would of course use the img tag there.

24
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,730
Now inside the img tag you will
supply the source as an attribute.

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,230
The class that you can use for images

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,960
using Bootstrap classes to
make the images responsive,

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,890
you would specify them as img-responsive.

28
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,360
This way your image will
automatically adapt as the website

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,760
is viewed on different screens.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,160
The image will automatically adapt itself
to the size of the parent element,

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,300
and appropriately,
will display on the screen.

32
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,330
Now, you can also use
additional classes to control

33
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,850
the shape in which the image is
being displayed on the screen.

34
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,140
You can use image rounded circle and
thumbnail.

35
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,840
Rounded will put rounded
corners to your image,

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,670
circle will obviously display
your image inside a circle.

37
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,117
And thumbnail would add
some borders to your image.

38
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:14,480
I wonder who that is?

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,180
In the example, you can see me using
image rounded, image circle and

40
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,530
image thumbnail on the image
being displayed there.

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,960
This is the result of using
the image classes in Bootstrap.

42
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,910
Another interesting class in
Bootstrap is the thumbnail class.

43
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,120
In a thumbnail class,
as you can see from the code there,

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,750
you would surround the content In
a div with the class thumbnail.

45
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,650
Now inside the thumbnail,
you will specify your image, and

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,800
in addition to the image, you can
also specify a caption for the image.

47
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,270
If you don't include the caption,

48
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,710
then it'll be displayed like
a thumbnail on this grid.

49
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,010
Now the thumbnail class is very useful for

50
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,990
creating a gallery of
images on your webpage.

51
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,890
If you want to you can also include
additional caption to your image.

52
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,460
In this example,
you see me using the caption to include

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,330
some additional information
together with the image there.

54
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,890
Another class that you can use
to display images in media,

55
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,300
is the media-object class.

56
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,335
To use the media-object class you would
enclose everything inside a media div.

57
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:44,720
And inside the media div you
would have two inner divs.

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,350
One with the media-left or
the media-right option.

59
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,830
And the second one with the media-body.

60
00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:00,650
Now, the display of the content will be
as shown in the example to the right.

61
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,770
The image will be displayed as
a thumbnail or whichever way you choose

62
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,870
to on the left side, and on the right side
the actual content will be displayed.

63
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:14,460
The media-object class is
very useful to construct

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,460
a list of items together with
a thumbnail on the left.

65
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,500
You have seen the usage of these on
many different places on websites.

66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,810
For example,
if you want to display a list of comments,

67
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,535
you could include also
the image of the commenters.

68
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:37,365
If you have a list of items
being displayed for example, on

69
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:41,805
a mobile device, you would often see that
there is a thumbnail along the left, and

70
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:48,530
some description on the right in the list
of items being displayed on the screen.

71
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,325
All of these will benefit
from the media-object class.

72
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:57,526
So exploring further, the media-object
class includes the media class,

73
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:00,137
which you apply to the outermost div.

74
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:05,167
The media-object class,
which you apply to the inner div.

75
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,200
The media-body class.

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,128
Then the media-heading class.

77
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:13,576
The media-heading class is
applied to the heading that is

78
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:16,398
displayed inside the media-body.

79
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:21,215
Now, positioning of the image
is controlled by using

80
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:25,940
the media-left and
the media-right classes.

81
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,370
The media-right div,

82
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,818
if you are using, should always be
placed after the media-body div.

83
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:37,460
Media-left div as you saw in the example,
is placed before the media-body div.

84
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:46,510
The media objects can also
be included inside lists,

85
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,930
by using a ul media-list
class being applied to it.

86
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,790
So, this would be one way that you
can display a list of comments

87
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,520
on your website.

88
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,270
You can also use another class
called a responsive embed for

89
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,940
embedding content on your websites.

90
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,100
We have seen when you embed content,
like videos on your website,

91
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,850
you would use tags like embed or
iframe or video tags there.

92
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:25,519
Now, any one of these can be embellished
using the Bootstraps embed-responsive tag.

93
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,804
And then together with
embed-responsive-16by9,

94
00:07:30,804 --> 00:07:33,998
or embed-responsive-4by3,

95
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:40,120
to specify the size of the embedded
object being displayed.

96
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,100
The embedded object itself carries
the embed responsive item class there.

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,209
So, embedding media content on your
webpage and making it responsive,

98
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:58,222
means that you apply
the embed-responsive-item

99
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:04,066
class to either the embed iframe,
video, or object tags.

100
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,170
You enclose that inside a div.

101
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,926
And for the div, you apply the
embed-responsive and embed-responsive-4by3

102
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:16,210
or embed-responsive-16by9
to the embed div itself.

103
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,250
We'll now move to our next exercise,
which examines images and media.

104
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,500
So in this exercise,

105
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,880
we're going to use the Bootstrap classes
to embed a sponsored image on our website.

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,680
We'll also use the media-object class
to include images on description

107
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,850
on our website.
