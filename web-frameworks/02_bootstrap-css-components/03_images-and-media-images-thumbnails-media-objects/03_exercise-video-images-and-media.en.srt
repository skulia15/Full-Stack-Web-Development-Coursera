1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,290
Okay, next exercise.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,050
We're going to examine images in media,
and

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,065
how we can include them into our webpages.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,620
First step, download the image dubbed
zip file that we have provided for you.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,190
Move the zip file to the confusion folder,
unzip it.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,680
You'll be left with a folder named
img in the confusion folder.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,460
This img folder contains

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,309
all the images that we're gonna
make use of in this exercise.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,640
Next, let's open our
project in brackets and

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,240
then have a look at the current
state of the webpage.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,008
In particular,
we'll be updating the index for

12
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:55,400
our HTML page by adding some images and
media objects into this pitch.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,230
So looking at the current state of the
webpage, you'll see that there is hardly

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,340
any images on this webpage,
and it looks fairly bland.

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,960
Well of course we had to wait until
we learned about images in media

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,130
before we could add these to our webpage.

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,270
So in this exercise we
are going to add images and

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,470
media to make the webpage a little
more exciting to look at.

19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,840
As our first step in adding
images to this webpage,

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,480
we are going to add the restaurant's
logo to this webpage.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,340
Now you see that there is some space to
the right hand side in this jumbotron.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,780
We are going to the put the restaurant's
logo in that location in the jumbotron.

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,880
In addition, you recall that in
the nav bar we had used the brand,

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,300
link there, and we'll use just text there
to represent the name of the restaurant.

25
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,830
We're gonna replace that with
the logo of this restaurant.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,804
Going to our index.html page,
we first scroll down to the jumbotron.

27
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,308
In the jumbotron,
I'm going to replace the second

28
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:20,010
column that we have there
by the restaurant's logo.

29
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,480
So we're going to use an image for the
restaurant's logo and then replace that

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,080
div class, or
include the image into the div class.

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,800
And then update the div
class appropriately.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,100
So let's do that.

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,400
And then we'll come back and
examine the code.

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,920
So here I have replaced the div class.

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,150
Now, I have reduced the size of
the div class to two column widths.

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,030
So I updated column sm to column sm 2
rather than column sm 4 which was earlier.

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,450
Now I'm going to use
the remaining two columns for

38
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,300
some other purpose in the assignment,
so we're gonna leave that as such.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,480
Inside this div,

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,090
now you see that I have included
the image of the restaurant's logo there.

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,570
So I'm using image, and the class that I'm
using for this image is img-responsive.

42
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,730
What this means is that this
image will automatically adapt to

43
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,690
the size of the containing parent
element which is the div class.

44
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,550
So, as the div class's size
changes from different screen

45
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,160
widths, the restaurant logo
image will automatically adapt.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,930
This is part of Bootstrap's class
support for sponsored images.

47
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,860
While we are at it,
we will as well update the navbar.

48
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:55,077
In the navbar you'll see that we have
the a tag with the navbar brand class.

49
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:59,790
We're going to replace that
navbar brand inside of the text.

50
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,760
We're gonna replace it with
the image of our restaurant's logo.

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,450
And then I will size
the image appropriately, so

52
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,740
that it can be nicely
placed in the navbar.

53
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,080
After updating the code inside the a tag,
you can now see that I have replaced

54
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,660
the text with an image which
is the logo of our restaurant.

55
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,100
I am using the height and width attributes
of this image to control the size

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,630
of the logo that is
displayed in the nav bar.

57
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,110
After making these changes,

58
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,950
let's go and have a look at
the current state of our webpage.

59
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,710
Going back to our webpage,

60
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,710
you can now see that the restaurant's
logo is included in the jumbotron.

61
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,820
In addition,
in the nav bar you can see that

62
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,450
the restaurant's name has been replaced
with the logo of the restaurant.

63
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,340
Now if you click on the logo, you're
going to be taken back to the home page.

64
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,270
Go ahead and apply the same changes
to both the jumbotron and the navbar.

65
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:11,860
In contactus.html file and
also the aboutus.html file.

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,863
Remember that all these
should have uniform

67
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:21,467
design of the jumbotron and the navbar.

68
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:27,240
So, go ahead and make those changes
to the remaining two HTML files also.

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,670
And then we'll go to the next step.

70
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,960
After updating the remaining
two HTML pages, you will see

71
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,680
that when you navigate to those pages,
you will see the logo in the navbar.

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,509
And also in the jumbotron.

73
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,880
Our next step is to use
the media object class

74
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,810
in Bootstrap to update the descriptions

75
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,020
that we have in the rows
of our index.html page.

76
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:06,260
So now you see that in the first row we
have the description of our dish there,

77
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,690
and in the third row we have
information about our master chef.

78
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,306
So we're going to use the media
object classes to update these

79
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:23,490
two to include both images as
well as the content as such.

80
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm not going to update
the content in the second row.

81
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,970
That will be left as an exercise for
you in the second assignment.

82
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,590
Getting back to the index.html page,
we are now going to replace this

83
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,530
description that we have for
our dish there with a media object.

84
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:52,050
I am going to include an image that we
already provide for you in the img folder.

85
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,100
And also, update the remaining
contents there to make

86
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,250
use of the media object to
display the description.

87
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,250
You can now see that I have
used the media class applied

88
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,170
to a div and inside of the div,
I am using the media left and

89
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,380
the media middle class
applied to an inner div.

90
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,780
Which includes the images of the dish.

91
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,930
Also, the description itself,
what was earlier in the div,

92
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:33,740
now I have moved into a media-body div
in there, the description as it exists.

93
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:41,620
The h2 tag that is showing
the name of the dish.

94
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,170
I am using the media heading class for
the h2 tag there.

95
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,740
Also, while I'm at it,
I also updated the a class that contains

96
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,400
the mode link there,
to turn it into a button.

97
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,480
Moving to the third rule that contains
the information about our executive chef.

98
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,850
I have also updated
the using the media object.

99
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,280
So I am including an image of the chef.

100
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,750
And also shifted the description
into the media body class in there.

101
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,810
Finally in the second row,

102
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,190
I am just updating the mole link
there to turn it into a button.

103
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,470
With this we complete all
the updates to the index.html page.

104
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,090
Let's save it and then go and

105
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:47,097
have a look at the final
version of the index.html page.

106
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,610
Returning to our webpage,
you will now see that in the webpage

107
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,900
the description of our dish has
been replaced by a media object.

108
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,320
You can notice that we
have included an image.

109
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,820
I'm using the image to the image there and

110
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,950
then the description on
the right-hand side.

111
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,100
Notice how the More link has been
updated into a button there.

112
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,573
In the second row also,
you see there are more data to a button.

113
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:26,550
And in the last row, again,
you see the description of

114
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,080
the Executive Chef updated, with
a picture of the Executive Chef in place.

115
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,300
This completes this exercise.

116
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,830
In this exercise we used the image

117
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,870
classes and the media object
class available within Bootstrap

118
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,650
to include images onto our web page.
