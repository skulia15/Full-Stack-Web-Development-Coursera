1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,180
Let me now talk about
two bootstrap components

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,450
than can be used to display
content on your webpage.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,150
In particular,
about Bootstrap Panels and Wells.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:23,060
Sometimes, within your webpage you may
want to highlight a piece of content.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,970
So that it's more clearly
visible to the users.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,290
Now, panels and
wells are two ways that you can highlight

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,822
content with a new webpage so that it's
more easily noticeable to the visitors.

8
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:44,970
Panels as you see,
allows you to display a content

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,990
inside a bounded box,
as you see in the picture here.

10
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:57,780
Now within this boundary box you can
have a simple boundary around the box.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,860
That would be a standard panel.

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,020
You can also have a panel
heading in place.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,650
So in the example that you see on the
screen, we have a panel heading in place.

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,900
And within the panel heading,
you can specify the content

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,530
to be displayed in the heading
by using the panel-title class.

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,725
So here in this example,

17
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:26,220
I am using the panel-title class
being applied to the h3 tag there.

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,070
And you can see the display off the panel
title in the panel on the right hand side.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,319
The panel body itself can
contain any HTML content.

20
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,050
Now in this example,

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,056
I am using a description list in order to

22
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:53,836
show some data about
the restaurant itself.

23
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:57,920
Now this is one way you can
use a description list.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,125
In particular,
I am using description list with the class

25
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:06,910
dl-horizontal, so that the term and

26
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,710
the description are displayed in
the same horizontal line here.

27
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,800
For a panel,
you can also specify a footer.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,830
If for your specific use situation
if footer makes more sense,

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,490
then just like you applied
the panel heading,

30
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,760
you can also define a panel footer
to be applied to the panel.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,060
Our next Bootstrap component is a Well.

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,890
A well,
as you'll see from the example here

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,795
is like a bounded box surrounded
with a light gray background here.

34
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,240
Inside this well,
you can include any content.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,920
Now to use a well,
you just apply the well class to a div.

36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,020
And inside the div, whatever content
that you include will be enclosed

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,950
inside this light gray bounded
box as you see on the right side.

38
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,160
In this example, you can also
see me using the block quote to

39
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,020
display a quotation from the user.

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,270
When you use a block code,
you will have the content being formatted,

41
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,480
as shown in the picture there with

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,000
a vertical bar on the left side
to highlight what content.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,060
For the block code,
we can also specify a footer.

44
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,210
There, you can specify
the source of this quotation.

45
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,180
Wells can also be qualified
by using the Well LG and

46
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,650
Well SM classes to define a large and
a small well.

47
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,910
What you see in the picture
is a default sized well.

48
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,380
If you would like a larger well,
then together with the well class,

49
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,770
you can use the well-lg class.

50
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,040
For a small well,
you can use the well-sm class.

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,690
Finally, we'll move on to the exercise for
this lecture, where we will look at

52
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:13,850
the use of Tables, Panels and
Wells in our webpage.

53
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,700
So we will create style and

54
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,110
present some tabular data in
the form of a Bootstrap table.

55
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,250
And we'll use Bootstrap's table
classes to style the table.

56
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,880
We'll also include a panel and
a well onto the webpage.
