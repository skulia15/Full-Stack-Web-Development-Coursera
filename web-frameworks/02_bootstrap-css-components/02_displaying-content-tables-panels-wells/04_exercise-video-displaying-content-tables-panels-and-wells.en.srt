1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,490
In this exercise, we're going to
learn about adding tables, panels,

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,330
and wells in order to display
content in our web page.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,482
For this exercise,

4
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:19,039
we're going to use the aboutus.html
page that have already created earlier.

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,448
And then we'll go in and
add a table there,

6
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:27,490
in the process learn how
Bootstrap tables are styled.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,900
Then, we will add a panel
there with some information.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,950
And finally, we'll add a well there,
with a quotation.

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,580
So in this process,
we'll learn about how we can arrange to

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,110
display content on our web page
in a more interesting manner.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,380
Taking a look at the current
state of the aboutus.html page.

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,700
As you can see in this page, we see that

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,370
on the right hand side here,
we have some empty space there.

14
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,861
So I'm gonna put a panel here
to display some information.

15
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:10,994
And also,
right after the history of the restaurant,

16
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:17,938
I'm gonna put in a well there
in order to display a quotation.

17
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,300
And we'll go in to the bottom of this
page, and then add an extra row there.

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:29,650
That is where we're going to add a table
of information about this restaurant.

19
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,700
Along the way, of course,

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,750
we will learn about the table classes
that are available in Bootstrap.

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,860
Going to the HTML code of
the aboutus.html page.

22
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:47,290
In brackets,
right after the Corporate Leadership row,

23
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,350
I'm going to add an extra row
there called Facts and Figures.

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,800
And inside this row, I'm going to
add a table that displays some

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,090
information about this restaurant.

26
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:06,450
So let me add the code, and I will come
back and review the code in more detail.

27
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,910
Let me first show you the result
of adding the table and

28
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,910
the row containing the table
to this aboutus.html page.

29
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,138
Now, when you look at the web page itself,

30
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:28,335
you will see that now we have a table
there that displaced some information.

31
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:33,335
In particular,
this table is designed in such

32
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:39,499
a way that alternate rows
are in a slightly darker color.

33
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:45,880
So that easily helps us to distinguish
between the rows of the table.

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,470
This is a class that we use called
table-striped in Bootstrap.

35
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,097
Let's look at the code to
understand how we go about

36
00:02:56,097 --> 00:02:59,227
creating a table in this web page.

37
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:08,547
Returning to the code,
now you see that I have added

38
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:13,920
another row here using
the row row-content class.

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,030
Inside that row,
I am declaring a column class here,

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,910
and inside the column class,
I'm going to include the table.

41
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:31,410
So to create a table, I am enclosing the
table in a div called table-responsive.

42
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,759
This makes the table responsive so that
when it is viewed even on a very small

43
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,606
screen, the table will
adjust appropriately.

44
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:42,425
And then if the table needs extra space,

45
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:47,704
then we'll be able to
horizontally scroll the table and

46
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:50,863
look at the details of the table.

47
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:58,035
Now, the table Itself, we use the table
HTML element to design the table.

48
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,352
So here, I have table.

49
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:03,995
For that, I have given
the class table table-striped.

50
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:09,484
So this way,
we make it very clear to Bootstrap

51
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:13,800
that we are using this
table as a real table.

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,115
Now, you do realize that people
often use the table class for

53
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,840
styling HTML pages themselves.

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,000
So we want to be clear that this table is
actually being used as a table itself.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,400
So that's why we use the class table here,
to specify that this is a real table.

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,667
And then the second qualification
that we are using is table-striped.

57
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:42,730
So, the table-striped class will
lead to a table with alternate

58
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,440
rows being in a different color so
that the table looks more clear.

59
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,880
There are many different table
styling classes that are available

60
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,270
within Bootstrap, so

61
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,890
you should explore some of those to
understand how they are used better.

62
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,710
Now, the table of contents themselves
are styled like a standard table

63
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,245
that you might have created earlier.

64
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:12,717
So there is no specific Bootstrap
classes that I am using for

65
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:15,230
the table content itself.

66
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,288
So here, you see there is a table row.

67
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:25,910
And inside the table row, I have all
the table information, the table.

68
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,780
These are the table headers here,
so I am using the th

69
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,560
tag here so that these will be
displayed in bold in the table.

70
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,000
So this particular row contains
all the heading information for

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
the table, header row for the table.

72
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,420
The next row contains

73
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,160
information that is displayed on
the first table row below the header row.

74
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,827
So that's why only for
the first column I am using the th.

75
00:05:55,827 --> 00:06:01,030
For the remaining columns,
I am using td to display the information.

76
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,256
Like that, you can go through
the remaining rows of the table.

77
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:12,602
And that is how we
include a table in a web

78
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:17,490
page using the Bootstrap classes.

79
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,930
Returning to the web page,

80
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,160
the next component that I'm going
to add to this page is a panel.

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:32,560
A panel allows you to display content
in the web page in a enclosed box here.

82
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,030
So here, if I scroll up,

83
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,340
I see that there is some empty space
on the right hand side in this row.

84
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,700
I'm going to leverage that empty space,
and then put a panel in place there.

85
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,194
Now, I want the panel to
occupy more number of columns.

86
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:51,891
So I'm going to shrink the column for

87
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:56,780
this particular part of
the content in this row so

88
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,954
that this occupies only eight columns and

89
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:07,770
then I'll be left with four columns
there to put a panel into place.

90
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,160
So let me go to the code and
then add in the panel code.

91
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,990
And then we'll come back and
look at the change to the web page.

92
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,780
And then, we'll review the code.

93
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,960
I have now added a panel to the web page.

94
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,973
So as you can see on the right side,

95
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:26,828
I have a panel which
displays some information.

96
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:33,230
Now, the panel carries a panel
header here, and also some content.

97
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,976
This content that I am displaying here,

98
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:44,722
I am making use of the description list,

99
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:48,613
the dl that is part of HTML.

100
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:53,290
So that is what I am using to display
the information inside this panel.

101
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,280
So let's go and

102
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,040
review the code to understand
how this panel has been created.

103
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,320
So coming to the code, you see that I have

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,640
added a div class with
the panel in place there.

105
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,970
And the panel classes that I am
using is panel and panel-primary.

106
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,929
So that is the reason why the panel
itself is displayed in blue color,

107
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:21,400
because I am using
panel-primary color there.

108
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,176
Inside the panel,
you see that I have two divs here.

109
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:26,705
The first div is a panel-heading,

110
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:31,350
so that is what contains the heading
that I am using for the panel.

111
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,925
So in here I define the panel-title
as an h3 class here,

112
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:41,840
so that will be displayed
in the panel-heading.

113
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,350
Down below here, I have the panel-body.

114
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,160
So this is where the content of
the panel has been enclosed.

115
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:56,720
Now, looking at the content here, you see
that I have a description list here, a dl.

116
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,700
And the class that I am using for
this is dl-horizontal.

117
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,710
What this means is that
in the description list,

118
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,150
the term is displayed on the left side and
the actual description of the term

119
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,580
is displayed on the right side
in the same horizontal line.

120
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,132
So here, I have the first group here,

121
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:23,808
so I have the dt that I am
using to specify started.

122
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:27,537
Then I am using the dd to specify
what goes into the description.

123
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:34,610
And similarly, repeating dt and dd here
for the second line there, and so on.

124
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,212
So I have four of these enclosed
inside of this dl class here.

125
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,830
So that is what creates the content

126
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,830
of this panel that is being
displayed in the web page.

127
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,405
Taking one final look at the panel,
you see that now,

128
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:56,821
the panel head is being
displayed here on the top.

129
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,567
And then the contents of the panel,
the dl,

130
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:02,249
is being displayed inside the panel here.

131
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:07,810
Panels can be used to highlight pieces
of information on your web page.

132
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,190
So this is a very interesting
component that is useful for

133
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,690
certain parts of our web page and design.

134
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,240
The last component that I'm going
to add to this web page is a well.

135
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,680
Now, I'm going to put a well here
in this row to display a quotation.

136
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,762
Now, this quotation I am going to make use
of the blockquotethat is available for

137
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:41,094
typography in Bootstrap to
style that particular well.

138
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:46,270
Let me add in the code, and then we'll
come back to look at the web page itself.

139
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,830
Coming back to the web page, now you can
see the use of a well on the web page.

140
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,434
Inside the well,
now I have a quotation which I am using

141
00:10:56,434 --> 00:11:01,450
the blockquote typography
support in Bootstrap to style.

142
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,499
So when I use a blockquote,

143
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:09,032
the blockquote will put a vertical bar
to the left side of this quotation.

144
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:13,126
And in addition,
I am using some additional features of

145
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:18,070
the blockquote in order to
display the actual content here.

146
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,700
Let's go and look at the code for
creating the well and the quotation here.

147
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Now coming back to the code here,

148
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,160
the well is created by using a div for
which I am specifying the class as well.

149
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,562
I can even specify the size
of the well as well followed

150
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:44,995
by well-lg or well-sm for
large and small wells.

151
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:49,945
Or, if I don't specify the size,
it'll be the default size well.

152
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:53,375
In this example,
I am using a default size well here.

153
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:59,140
Now, inside the well, I can enclose
whatever content that I wish to.

154
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:06,350
So inside the well, I am using a
blockquote to enclose the quotation there.

155
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,097
Now if I use a blockquote and
put some content inside the blockquote,

156
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:17,530
what Bootstrap will do is to display
a vertical bar to the left hand side

157
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:23,330
of the blockquote to highlight
that as a quotation on the screen.

158
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,435
Now inside the blockquote,

159
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:29,910
you see that I have a p element here
which encloses the actual quotation.

160
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,690
And then in addition,
I am making use of the footer here.

161
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,194
This footer inside a blockquote
allows me to specify

162
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:45,290
the author, or
the person who said the quotation.

163
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,360
So in this case,
this quotation was by Yogi Berra,

164
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,270
which I found to be funny enough
to include in the web page.

165
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:58,440
And also, I can use this cite

166
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,720
tag to display the source
of this information.

167
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,830
So here, I say cite and
then I say the title as source title.

168
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,660
And then,
I specify the information inside there.

169
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,082
So this will be displayed as
the source of this quotation.

170
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:19,136
Coming back to the web page,
now you can see how this well and

171
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:24,222
the quotation inside the well have
been created using the well class and

172
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:26,870
the blockquote class in Bootstrap.

173
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,600
So this completes this exercise.

174
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,191
So in this exercise,
we have looked at the use of tables,

175
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:42,690
panels, and wells in displaying
content on our web page.

176
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,010
Now, you can make use of these components
at many other locations on your web page,

177
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,840
depending on what you're
trying to display there.

178
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,242
But, this is just one example to
illustrate how we can leverage

179
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:57,130
these components to display
content on our web page.
