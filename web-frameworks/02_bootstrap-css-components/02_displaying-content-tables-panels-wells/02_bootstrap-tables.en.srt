1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,730
Okay, let's turn the tables
on Bootstrap Tables.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:11,150
We'll talk about Bootstrap support for
tables using the Bootstrap classes.

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,540
Now when tables were first introduced
into HTML, they were meant for

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,980
displaying tabular data on a webpage.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,860
Tables have been hijacked for

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,740
many other purposes, something
completely other than tabular data.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,570
We have seen people using tables for

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,840
formatting contents to be
displayed on their pages.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,750
Those were the days when
we had no other means of

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,930
controlling the display of
content on our webpages.

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,820
Now with the advent of grid
systems like the Bootstrap grid,

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,339
I don't see any more reason
to continue using tables for

13
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:03,060
matching content on their pages.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,910
Now this is one of my pet peeves,
but anyway, aside from that,

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,780
let's talk about tables as
they're originally intended for.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,210
Which is to display tabular
data on our webpages.

17
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,890
In HTML of course, the table tag is
meant for displaying tabular data.

18
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,450
Bootstrap supplies

19
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,630
a class called the table class which
you can apply to the table tag.

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,910
Now you are wondering, why do we
need a table class for a table tag?

21
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,500
A table tag is itself a table.

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,410
Now Bootstraps intention for using the
table class use to make it very clear that

23
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:49,850
this table is actually being used to
format tabular data in their pitch.

24
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,810
That's the reason why they
provide the table class.

25
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,120
So we would always see Bootstrap's

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,539
formatting of tables starting
with the table class.

27
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,280
Besides the table class,

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,110
we have many other table classes
available within Bootstrap.

29
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,982
So along with table,
you should be using either table-striped,

30
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:19,000
table-bordered, table-hover,
table-condensed and table-responsive.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,100
Now among these, in the exercise,
we will look at the use of table-striped.

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,750
This creates tables with zebra striped
rows meaning that alternate rows have

33
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,510
somewhat darker color than the other rows.

34
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,965
So that we can more easily distinguish
between the rows within the table.

35
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:50,560
Table-bordered class puts
borders onto the tables.

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,798
So in case you want tables
with borders in place,

37
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,795
then you could use the table borders.

38
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:59,820
Table-hover works in this way,

39
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,620
when you use your mouse to touch
on any of the rows of the table.

40
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,710
Then that row will be highlighted for you.

41
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,430
You can use table-condensed if you want
to reduce the amount of cell padding

42
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,650
that is standard in Bootstrap tables.

43
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,940
If you are using tables and
you want your table to be responsive.

44
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,120
Meaning that when the table is viewed on

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,260
extra small screens you still want
the table to be fairly well displayed.

46
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,960
Now on extra small screens that is
screen sizes less than 768 pixels,

47
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:44,140
the table is turned into something
that can be scrolled horizontally.

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:50,090
So if your entire table is unable to fit
the screen, then Bootstrap will allow that

49
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,310
table to be scrolled in order to
be read properly by the users.

50
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:02,450
In addition,
we have five classes that can be used for

51
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,150
coloring the table rows,
as well as table cells.

52
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,080
There are classes are active,
success, info, warning and danger.

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:18,120
We have already seen these in the context
of collage, these adjectives being used.

54
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,760
So you can apply these to
either the table rows, or

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,770
individual cells within your table.

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,980
This completes our discussion of
tables and Bootstrap table classes.
