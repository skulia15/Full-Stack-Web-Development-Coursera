00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,830
Let us now talk about
Bootstrap support for forms.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,090
In particular,

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,870
the various classes that Bootstrap
provides in order to style the forms.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,160
We have seen forms already in a lot
of detail, in the previous course.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,464
So in this lecture,
I will primarily deal with Bootstrap's

6
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:27,940
own classes that are available
to style the forms.

7
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:34,580
Forms in Bootstrap are created
using the form tags.

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,140
So all the elements of the form
are enclosed inside the form tags.

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,490
If we do not specify any class for
the form, then the standard layout for

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,090
the form is used.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,341
We can specify the form
class as form-horizontal.

12
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:58,649
And if we do that,
then we can have the labels

13
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,790
to be displayed to the left
side of the data entry fields.

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,760
So as you see in this particular example,
when you specify

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,370
a label together with
the data entry element,

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,370
then we would use a form-group
to enclose these two.

17
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:28,090
So in here, I am specifying
the label as the first name there,

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,780
which is shown in the form
on the left hand side.

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,020
To the right of it in
the same horizontal line,

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:44,150
the actual field for
entering the data is shown.

21
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,880
Now by default within Bootstrap,

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,030
the form group supports the row class.

23
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,550
So inside the form group,
you can use the column classes

24
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,220
in order to style the elements
inside the form group.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,687
So here, you see me using the column
class for both the label as well as for

26
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:12,690
the input element there.

27
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,400
We can also define inline forms.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,210
Inline forms are shown
completely in a single line.

29
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,440
So this could be very useful, for example,

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,700
if you want to include in
your navbar a method for

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,560
the user to type in their username and
password and log in to your website.

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,840
So inline forms use the class form-inline,
and

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,720
inside there you can
specify the form groups.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,760
In particular, in this example,
you see that for the label

35
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,470
tag, I am specifying the class as sr-only,

36
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,100
meaning that those labels
are valid only for screen readers.

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,870
Now for a normal visual display,
those labels will be hidden.

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,530
Instead, we are using the placeholder
inside the form element itself

39
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,070
to identify what the user is supposed
to type into that field in the form.

40
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,292
Another class that Bootstrap supports
is called as an input-group.

41
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:23,820
An input-group allows you to
group together a set of elements.

42
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,642
Now, for any data entry field
that you have within your form,

43
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:32,259
you can also have an input-group-addon, so

44
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:37,381
that you can add elements to the left and
right side of your group.

45
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:41,825
So in this example,
you see me including the left and

46
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:48,390
right parenthesis to the field where I
allow the user to type in an area code.

47
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,570
Say, for example, a telephone number.

48
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,477
So in here, I am attaching using the
input-group-addon the left parentheses,

49
00:03:57,477 --> 00:04:02,545
and the input-group-addon the right
parentheses for this group.

50
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:07,505
So these group addons,
I am taking the help of a div to

51
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:12,075
put them together with my field there.

52
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:14,265
Now, we'll move on to the next exercise,

53
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:17,085
where we'll continue to
work on our website.

54
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:21,498
We're gonna add buttons to the web site,
and

55
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:26,262
also use various form
elements in order to create

56
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:30,345
a user feedback form for our restaurant.
