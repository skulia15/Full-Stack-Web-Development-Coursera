1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,080
In this exercise, we're gonna learn
more about buttons and forms.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,550
We're going to learn how to
add buttons to your website,

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,260
how to style them using the button
classes that are available in.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,302
We'll also learn about and
how we create and style the elements.

5
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:26,229
Using classes.

6
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:32,089
To get started download the contactus.html
file that we have provided for

7
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:35,915
you and
then move it to the Con Fusion folder.

8
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:40,815
Now this file we are going to
integrate it into our website.

9
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:46,555
So when you open the webpage in a browser,

10
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,565
this is what it is going to look like,
in the browser.

11
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:58,680
So you can see that on the webpage we have

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:06,330
the web page already partially
styled by us, with some information.

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,710
Now within this web page,
you're going to add some buttons, and

14
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,448
also add in a form for
the user to submit feedback

15
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:20,090
to their restaurant.

16
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,040
Before we get started adding forms and

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,610
buttons, let's first integrate
this web page into our website.

18
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,840
So this means that we have to go into
the nav bar and then set up all the links

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,670
correctly in the nav bar,
not only for contactus.html page, but

20
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,140
also the previous two pages,
index.html and aboutus.html.

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,770
So you all know how to do this, so go and
edit the nav bars on these three pages.

22
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,850
And update the links there, so
that you can move from any page to

23
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,870
any other page by just clicking
the links on the nav bars.

24
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,600
In addition, while you are at it,
add two new glyphicons,

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,730
and icon to the Nav bar.

26
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,820
One for the Menu item and
one for the Contact Us item.

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,185
So we'll be using a glyph icon for
the Menu item and will use another

28
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:29,493
Font Awesome icon for
the contact link in our nav bar.

29
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:32,686
So as specified in the instructions,

30
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:38,188
let's update these nav bars and
come back and look at the result.

31
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:41,925
Taking a look at the contactus.html page,

32
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:47,278
let me quickly review how I added
the two icons into the navbar.

33
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,768
For the menu item,

34
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:54,181
you can see that I am using
a glyphicon-list-alt for the menu item.

35
00:02:54,181 --> 00:03:00,651
And for the contact item,
I am using a Font Awesome,

36
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:08,170
Font Awesome envelope icon for
the contact links there.

37
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:15,170
Our next step is to add a button
bar to the contactus.html page.

38
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,040
Now when you go into the page,
you will see that we have identified

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,480
the location where the button
group is going to be added.

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,110
So go into that location and
then we'll replace this

41
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,680
line there with the code for
the button groups.

42
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,870
After replacing the code, let's quickly
review what this new code does here.

43
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,290
So you can see that in this new code,

44
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,930
I have defined a div with
a class called btn-group.

45
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,750
So this contains a group of buttons.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,480
I have three buttons in here, and I am
using the a tag to define the button so

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,300
I am saying a type button, and for

48
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,220
the class I am using button button
primary for one of the buttons.

49
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,730
This button is a button to make
a phone call to the restaurant.

50
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,390
So, that's why for the H graph I am
specifying it as it telephone and

51
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,700
the phone number of the restaurant.

52
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,440
The second button is for Skype.

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,610
So I have included,
again, Skype button here,

54
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,890
and also included a Font Awesome icon for
Skype there.

55
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,050
The third button is for sending emails.

56
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:46,530
So I have updated the A tag, with
the btn btn-success, and then the href,

57
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,430
I am setting it to the mail
ID of the restaurant.

58
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,990
Of course,
remember that this is a fake mail ID, so

59
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,726
don't try to send mail to that ID.

60
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:07,720
And also,
I added an envelope icon to the email.

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,411
So after making this changes,
let's go and review our webpage.

62
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:17,205
Returning to our webpage,
you would notice that now the,

63
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:26,010
Nav bar has been updated with icons for
all the links in the nav bar.

64
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,470
Second point to note is
the addition of the three

65
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,360
buttons, in a button bar,
to the contents of the website.

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,150
So now you can see that I have three
buttons here, call, Skype, and email.

67
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,560
Now, this blue outline here is
because I am using brackets.

68
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,720
So whenever I am editing
any code in brackets,

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,340
you will see the blue line appear there.

70
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,220
So let me just turn that off so
that's it's more clear to you.

71
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,800
So let's take a look at the button bar.

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,675
So you can see that in the button
bar now I have three buttons here.

73
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,355
The Call button, the Skype button,
and the Email button.

74
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:16,942
So if we click on any one of these then
the appropriate function will be started.

75
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:20,952
In our next set of step,
we're going to add the form

76
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:25,762
element to the contactus.html webpage.

77
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:33,232
So here where it says form goes here,
I'm going to create a feedback form

78
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:39,010
that the visitors can used to
send feedback to the restaurant.

79
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,730
Of course at the end of this exercise this
form will not work at the moment because

80
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,650
we don't have the server side setup to
receive the information from the form, but

81
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,810
in the later courses
they will activate this

82
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,760
form to be able to submit
information to the restaurant.

83
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,900
Returning to our web page.

84
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,270
In brackets, I'm going to
replace this form goes here with

85
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,660
a set of code in order
to create a simple form.

86
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,840
I have now substituted
the form code in place.

87
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,180
In the HTML code let's quickly review
the new code that we have added,

88
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,280
so you can see that I have
added a form tag here, and

89
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,740
with a class horizontal, which means that
there are items in this form will be layed

90
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,490
out in the horizontal manner, so we have
already seen the form horizontal class for

91
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,510
our bootstrap,
when we debuted forms in bootstrap.

92
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,548
Inside that form class,
I have two form-groups here.

93
00:07:53,548 --> 00:08:02,370
The first form-group is used to
create the entry for the first name.

94
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:10,150
The second form group is to create
the entry point for the last name here.

95
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,955
So after making these changes let's go and
look at the result.

96
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:20,745
So you can now notice that on
the webpage we now have two fields

97
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:25,990
that have been created for entering the
first name and the last name of the users.

98
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,430
Pertaining to the HTML code, let me just
remind you again that the form group

99
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,130
class automatically adds
the row features to that diff.

100
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,680
So inside that, whatever contents we have,

101
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,280
we can now apply column
classes to that content.

102
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,385
So that's why you see me applying
col-sm-2 to the label and

103
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:50,900
col-sm-10 to the div in here.

104
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,510
So this is a nested set of columns for
this row.

105
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:03,560
This is nested inside another column
which is in the webpage itself.

106
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,100
Our next iteration to the HTML code for
the farm is to create

107
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:17,170
the input group for
entering the telephone number.

108
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,630
Now when I clear the info group for
the telephone number.

109
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:27,540
You would see that I'm
using the form group.

110
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,888
Now, inside the form group I'm using
an input-group here in the code.

111
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:39,600
This input-group contains an input

112
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,460
group add on which allows me
to add the left parentheses,

113
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,120
and another input group add on that
allows me to add the right parenthesis

114
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
to that particular input element there.

115
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,940
So this input element I am using it to
allow the user to enter the area code.

116
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,415
So if you're familiar with the US
phone number representations

117
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:05,291
you will see that the area code is
always enclosed inside parentheses.

118
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:10,377
So this allows me to add add ons

119
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:15,473
to the input elements there.

120
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:19,022
Now in addition I have
added in one more field for

121
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:22,050
allowing the user to enter their email.

122
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,390
So if this is the email ID field here,
the label, and the input there.

123
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,244
So after making these changes,
let's go and have a look at the page.

124
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:37,820
Now in the webpage, you see that
we now have the contact telephone

125
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,350
number, which can be specified
as an area code within

126
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,190
parenthesis, and
the telephone number next to it.

127
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,675
The email can be entered
in the email field.

128
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:56,715
Our next addition to
the font is a check box,

129
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:02,965
which allows the user to specify whether
they want to be contacted or not.

130
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:09,535
In addition, I am using a select
element in order to let the users

131
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:14,520
specify whether they want to be
contacted by telephone or by email.

132
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,549
So, adding these two.

133
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,579
Looking at the code, you see that I have
a form-group here which encloses that.

134
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,949
And inside of that I am defining
a div with a check box in here.

135
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:29,848
And I have an input type
check box in there.

136
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:32,719
And then correspondingly,

137
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:37,920
the message there saying,
may we contact you?

138
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,470
Question mark.

139
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,943
So if the user checks the check box,

140
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:45,840
then the user is indicating
that they could be contacted.

141
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,930
So that is enclosed inside
this check box in here.

142
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,930
Now below that,
I have a select element there.

143
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,630
For the select element I have two options.

144
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,110
Telephone and email.

145
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,140
After making these changes,
let's go back and look at our webpage.

146
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,450
Now before we go, let me show you how
we have styled these elements here,

147
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,980
and how we have specified
the column classes.

148
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,390
Now, as you recall, the form group
already provides the row class for us.

149
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,350
So inside there, the checkbox div,

150
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,650
I have given it appropriate
column specification there.

151
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:37,300
And then also, the select

152
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,530
element I have given the appropriate
column specification there.

153
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:47,890
So I want you to make specific note
of this information in the coach.

154
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,320
Now let's go and look at the page.

155
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,380
Now you see that in the web page,

156
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,100
we now have a check box which
we can check on or off.

157
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:03,010
And then the message there, and also
this selector element which allows us to

158
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,170
specify whether we want to be
contacted by telephone or email.

159
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,150
The next element what we are adding
to the form is a textarea.

160
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,830
This is the place where
the user can type in.

161
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,460
They're comics.

162
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,840
So here I am using another form-group for
that.

163
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,340
And inside that form-group,
I have a label to specify the information.

164
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,749
And then I am using another dev,
which in close text area

165
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:38,790
whose values are set
to be 12 rows there so

166
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,760
the text area will allow the user
to input 12 rows of text in there.

167
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,300
So with these changes,
again going back to our webpage,

168
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,670
this is the next result of adding
the text area to our webpage.

169
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,554
So now you see that your feedback page is

170
00:13:57,554 --> 00:14:02,010
already taking very well.

171
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,650
Our last addition to the form
is the submit button.

172
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,710
So here I am creating a submit
button by using the button and

173
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,860
specifying its type as submit.

174
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,670
I specify the classes btn btn-primary and
then specify that

175
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:30,610
the contents inside the button that should
be displayed the text inside the button.

176
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,980
And also, I specified for the dev.

177
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:41,180
I used the classes to appropriately
position the button in the.

178
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,980
With these changes, let's go and
have one final look at our webpage.

179
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,940
Going back to our webpage,
we now see that the form is now complete.

180
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,770
So you can see that you have all
the various fields in the form.

181
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,020
And also we have specified the button

182
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,570
which the user clicks in order
to submit the form information.

183
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,430
Now, taking one final look at
our web page, in this exercise

184
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,730
we have added a new page called
contact us to HTML to our website.

185
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,040
We styled the nav bar

186
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,140
specifying icons for
all the links in the nav bar.

187
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:36,064
Then we added the button
bar here that allows users

188
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:41,450
to either call, Skype or
email the company.

189
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,370
And finally we added a form for

190
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,760
the users to send back
comments to the restaurant.

191
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,260
And we used various form elements,
and Bootstrap's classes,

192
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,110
in order to style the form appropriately.

193
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,540
This completes this exercise.
