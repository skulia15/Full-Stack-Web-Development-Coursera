1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's now talk about user input.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,180
Gone are the days when websites purely
delivered information to the user through

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,280
the browser.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,510
And at most they would have
hyperlinks that you could click to

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,780
move to other pages in the website.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,585
Most websites these days
provide many different ways for

7
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:24,208
the user to interact with the website.

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:29,094
Say in the form of buttons or
fonts that the user can fill out

9
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:33,680
information and
submit to the server and so on.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,200
So let's look at some of
these in more detail.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,290
To help us understand the various
ways a website can provide for

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,150
users to interact, let's just quickly
pay a visit to your course website.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,180
Now here you see a lot of
buttons on the screen so

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,470
you can see a button that you can click.

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,700
You can see a search box where
you can type in information and

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,490
then press this button in
order to initiate a search.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,890
You might have other buttons
that you can click to

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,550
be able to cause some actions to be taken.

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,000
You could even have
hyperlinks on the website.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,610
So hyperlinks still do exist on websites
that will take you to other parts

21
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,050
of your website.

22
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,250
All the user inputs to your website
boils down to three different

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,380
tags that can be used for this purpose.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,020
We have the <a> tag, which was
originally designed for hyperlinks.

25
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,560
So you have the h ref attribute for the
a tag through which you can specify what

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,640
should be done when the user
clicks on the hyperlink.

27
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,260
Then we have buttons.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,080
Buttons typically,
the moment you put a button,

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,050
you are automatically prompting
the user to click the button.

30
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,990
So that's how users would
interact with buttons.

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,290
Button was added to the HTML
specification later on to provide

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,320
a separate way from hyperlinks
to enable user interaction.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,130
Then of course we have forms.

34
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,240
Forms provide for
more detailed interaction from the user.

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,420
User can submit information
by typing in things into

36
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,400
the various boxes that you provide,
and then click a button in

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,580
order to submit the information
that you entered into the form.

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,390
Buttons themselves are a very

39
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,320
straightforward way of providing
interaction to the user.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,920
Once you put a button, you're expecting
the user to click on that button.

41
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,350
Button behavior can

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,110
vary depending on where the button
is positioned within your website.

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,310
If a button is included inside a form, the
general expectation is that when you click

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,800
on the button the form
information will be submitted.

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,710
Buttons outside the form may
take on many other roles.

46
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:09,239
So clicking on a button may open or
hide parts of information in your webpage.

47
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,598
Maybe open a model on the screen that

48
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,400
allows you to view other information.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,166
So we will see some of these uses
of buttons in the next module.

50
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:28,490
The <a> tag itself has
many times been hijacked

51
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,620
and transformed into a button
through the use of CSS.

52
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,820
Indeed even Bootstrap itself you
can easily turn an a tag into

53
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,850
a button-like form very easily.

54
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,990
Which is something that we will see
in the later lectures and exercise.

55
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,070
Forms, of course, are the grandaddy
of information submission.

56
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,245
They provide you with many different
fields that you can fill in,

57
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:59,475
input fields that allow you to
specify different kinds of inputs.

58
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:02,715
And then we have text areas
which are much larger

59
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:07,925
boxes which allow you to fill
in more detailed information.

60
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:12,185
You could have buttons of course,
within a form that allows

61
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,210
the triggering of the submission of the
information that you enter into the form.

62
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,940
Then you have select.

63
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,880
And select allows you to select from
a predetermined set of choices,

64
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,408
then you have checkboxes,
then you have radio buttons.

65
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:30,180
So all of these combinations allow

66
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,790
forms to be very versatile in
seeking information from the user.

67
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,490
So in the next set of lectures we're
gonna review Bootstrap Button Classes and

68
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,620
then subsequently we'll look at
Bootstrap Classes to style forms.
