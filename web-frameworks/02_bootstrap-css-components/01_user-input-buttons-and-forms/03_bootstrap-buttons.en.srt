1
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,120
Let's now talk about Bootstrap's buttons.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,082
In particular, the various classes
that Bootstrap provides for

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:14,419
you to include buttons in your website,
and

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,771
also to style the buttons
in various forms.

5
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:27,423
The default Bootstrap setup is
configured with five different colors,

6
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:32,389
and these colors can be
specified within Bootstrap or

7
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:37,575
attached as qualifiers for
previous classes in the form

8
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:43,250
of primary, success,
info, warning and danger.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,271
There five corresponding colors
in the default Bootstrap set up.

10
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:53,879
Is darker blue for primary, green for
success, light blue for info,

11
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,143
an orange color,
somewhat of an orange yellow color for

12
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,630
warning, and red color for danger.

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,480
These five colors, identifications,

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,240
can be used together with many
of the Bootstrap classes.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,860
So, for example,
if we want to set a text to

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:25,840
light blue in color they can say text
info or you can say text primaries.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,790
You can say button success for
a green colored button, similarly,

18
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:37,830
alert danger for red colored and
text to be displayed.

19
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,260
Similarly, background info for

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,130
a blue colored background to
be created for an element.

21
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,300
So, this standard five color combinations

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,490
can be used together with many
classes to specify colors for

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,200
those elements in Bootstrap.

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,830
Bootstrap provides various
button classes that

25
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,080
allow you to style your
buttons in various ways.

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,970
Now, these button classes can be applied
to the <a> tags, to the <button> tag,

27
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,600
as well to the <input> tags
that you use on your web site.

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,470
All these can be styled
using the button class.

29
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,380
So, all of them when you apply
the Bootstrap button classes,

30
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,660
will take the form of a button,
they all look like a button on the screen.

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,065
But, in particular only button
tags can be used inside navs and

32
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:42,360
navbars if you want to include
a button in the nav or navbar.

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,040
Let's take a look at some example buttons
and how they are defined in code.

34
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,580
So, looking at the example that
we have on the screen here.

35
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,870
You can see that I have defined
five different kinds of buttons,

36
00:02:57,025 --> 00:03:01,755
the large button that you see there
has been styled using button,

37
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:05,665
button primary, button LG class.

38
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:09,095
And, similarly the default,
the small success button,

39
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:13,060
the extra small buttons, and even links.

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,570
The two buttons on the right side here

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,510
they use the button class
called button block.

42
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,940
This essentially makes those buttons span

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,890
the entire payment block within
which this button is contained.

44
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,850
So, in this case, the two buttons
are spanning an entire column.

45
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,738
So, they are spanning three columns
in that particular row there.

46
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:41,740
To summarize, Bootstraps button
classes application can be done

47
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,920
by selecting one from each
of these four choices here.

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,770
So, if you need to apply the button class
to any A or Button R, the input element.

49
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,870
You would specify the class as BTN.

50
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,260
Then followed by one of the color choices
that we have there button default,

51
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,650
button success, button info and so on.

52
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,040
Then you can also specify
the size of the button.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,310
So, you can say button large,
button small, button xs.

54
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,630
And of course that if you
don't specify a size,

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,130
the default button size will be used.

56
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,520
And you can also make the button

57
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,630
occupy the entire block by
using the btn-block class.

58
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,940
Bootstrap also allows you to
group buttons into button groups.

59
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,410
So, when you group a set of
buttons into button groups,

60
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,710
these buttons are displayed
together as a single unit.

61
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,750
So, in the picture what you see here,

62
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,580
we have three different kinds
of button groups being used.

63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,040
The left two button groups
are enclosed inside a button toolbar.

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,960
So, you enclose button groups
inside a button toolbar.

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,468
So, how do we apply the button classes for
applying the button group?

66
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:04,750
You use btn-group class,
then you can specify the size, also,

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,940
as btn-group -smlgr excess,
if you would like to specify.

68
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,360
You can also specify the orientation for
the patterns as vertical.

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,957
Normally, the buttons will be done in
a horizontal manner if you include them in

70
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:22,150
a button group.

71
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,710
But, you can specify that the button
group is button group vertical so

72
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:32,480
the buttons are going to be laid
out stacked one upon the other.

73
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,410
As you see in the example
on the right side.

74
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,250
So, you have the three buttons in for
warning and

75
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,160
danger buttons stacked
one on top of the other.

76
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,011
And the corresponding code for causing
this is shown right there in the slide.

77
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:52,850
Finally, summarizing, for buttons we
have the button class, BTN class,

78
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:59,680
then you have the colors, then you have
the sizes that can be used in combination.

79
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,950
Buttons can be grouped using button
toolbar, button group, button group

80
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:09,300
vertical button group justified meaning
that the buttons will stretch to occupy

81
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,680
the entire space that they are allowed
to occupy based upon appearance size.

82
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,370
So, if they are included in a column then
they stretch to occupy the entire color.

83
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:32,960
And of course you have the button group
with the size being specified large,

84
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,969
small, and extra small.
