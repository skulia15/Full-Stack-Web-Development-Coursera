1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,123
Let me now quickly
introduce you to Bootstrap,

2
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:12,359
the front-end UI framework that we're
gonna deal with in this course.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,313
Bootstrap, as described
on its own website,

4
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:26,153
says that it is the most popular HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript based framework for

5
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:31,780
developing responsive,
mobile first projects on the web.

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,680
This is definitely true that
Bootstrap is one of the most

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,070
widely used frameworks for web design.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,990
Now, when you look at the bootstrap
framework itself, it is a framework

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:55,410
designed for enabling people to
design websites faster and easier.

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,480
It provides a lot of interesting HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript based templates.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,390
Which you will encounter as
we go through this course.

12
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,400
And enables us to design websites
very quickly using these components.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,571
And Bootstrap has built-in support for

14
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:23,945
responsive design using
the mobile first approach.

15
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:30,002
We will see in the next few lessons,
how the responsive

16
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:36,817
mobile-first approach of Bootstrap can be
leveraged to design responsive websites.

17
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:42,997
Bootstrap was first released in 2011
by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton.

18
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,497
They were Twitter employees
that designed Bootstrap for

19
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,140
their own use within the company.

20
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,370
And then, later,
decided to make it open source.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,350
Currently Bootstrap is in version 3.3.5.

22
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,035
4.0 is already on the horizon,
will be released soon.

23
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:07,030
Bootstrap has maintained backward
compatibility as far as possible,

24
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,430
but Bootstrap 3 was a big
step forward in supporting

25
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,070
responsive web design in a much better
manner than earlier versions of Bootstrap.

26
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,290
So, definitely it is worth considering and

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,120
worth learning because it was one of
the first comprehensive frameworks

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,730
that was available for use.

29
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,750
So we'll move on to the next lesson,

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,728
where we will first get familiar with
Bootstrap and how to make use of Bootstrap

31
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,850
within our project.
