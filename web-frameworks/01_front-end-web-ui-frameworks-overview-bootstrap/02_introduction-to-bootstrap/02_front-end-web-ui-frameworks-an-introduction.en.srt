1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,659
Front-end web UI frameworks
are increasingly becoming the approach for

2
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:12,431
designing and
implementing websites quickly.

3
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:18,063
Let's examine some details of front-end
web UI frameworks in this lecture.

4
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:23,948
We last covered service.

5
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:26,549
What are front-end web UI frameworks?

6
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:32,865
Then we'll look at why we would be
interested in using a front-end framework

7
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:38,124
and finally a list of the popular
front-end web UI frameworks.

8
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,480
What exactly do front-end web
UI frameworks provide for you?

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,140
Now typically a front-end web UI framework
is a collection Of HTML, CSS, and

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,330
Javascript templates that enable you to
quickly design and implement your website.

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,030
So they will provide a collection
of components like Buttons,

12
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,280
Tables, Navigation bars,
Modals, Accordions,

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Carousels and Dropdowns and
many other features.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,580
And also addressing Typography and
color schemes for your website.

15
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,600
Why should we be interested using
front-end web UI frameworks?

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,729
One of the primary reasons
is responsive web design.

17
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:39,150
Now, we will examine responsive web design
in more detail in the next lecture.

18
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,410
Here, let me quickly summarize
what we mean by this.

19
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,880
We realize that people are accessing
websites using various different

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,302
devices of different screen sizes.

21
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:56,712
Now how do we target these different
screen sizes by using a single website

22
00:01:56,712 --> 00:02:02,395
design and make our website automatically
adapt to different screen sizes.

23
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:07,505
So that is one of the primary issues
being addressed by responsive web design.

24
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:11,955
In particular, we see an increasing
trend towards mobile first.

25
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:17,745
Meaning that first, design your website
with the mobile screen size in mind,

26
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:22,000
and then adapt to larger
screen sizes from there.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,628
We'll also look at mobile first design
in more detail in the next lecture.

28
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:33,356
A second reason why you might be
interested in front-end frameworks,

29
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:37,770
is that different browsers
have different quirks in them.

30
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,510
So we need a way of commonly targeting
all the different browsers so

31
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,930
that our website renders
uniformly independent

32
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,690
of which browser a user
uses to access our website.

33
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,460
Now addressing the quirks of different
browsers is not that straightforward.

34
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,110
Fortunately for us,

35
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,020
these frameworks have already taken
care of addressing these issues so

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,840
that it becomes straightforward for
us to concentrate on our website design.

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,950
And if we make use of the front-end
frameworks, they will automatically take

38
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,060
care of the problems of addressing
the different browser issues.

39
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,350
A third and equally important reason for

40
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,905
using a front-end framework
is increased productivity.

41
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:34,436
Now designing websites,
from the scratch, is quite cumbersome.

42
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:39,725
Now, because these front-end
frameworks provide us with a lot of

43
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:44,795
features and competence, it becomes more
straightforward to design our website

44
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:46,515
with a consistent look and feel.

45
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:52,414
Finally, let's not underestimate
the community support that

46
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:54,716
a front-end framework enjoys.

47
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:59,802
Now, the larger the community that
participates in a front-end framework,

48
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:04,656
the larger the resources that we have
available to us that we can leverage to

49
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:10,160
address issues that we might encounter
in using a front-end framework.

50
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,434
You might find a lot of examples out
there, you might find people posting

51
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:20,235
blog entries addressing various features.

52
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:24,422
That is very very important when
you need to quickly get started

53
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:26,165
implementing a website.

54
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:34,880
Finally let's look at some of
the popular front-end frameworks.

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,533
Now this is a small list.

56
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:43,570
There are a large number of
front-end frameworks out there.

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,420
I'm giving you the list of
the most popular among them.

58
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:55,380
Now, again, I might have missed out
your favorite front-end web framework.

59
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,520
Don't get too worked up about it.

60
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,340
People have different opinions on this.

61
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,130
Now this is one of the most
opinionated areas of website design.

62
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,760
People tend to hang on to their
favorite web UI frameworks and

63
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,890
insist that that is the best
way to address the problem.

64
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,115
Again, we should all take this
with a big grain of salt.

65
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:22,930
Maybe I should say a big rock
of salt after all, but anyway.

66
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:30,560
Based upon looking at several
different plug entries,

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,620
this is the list that I feel
comfortable with in presenting to you.

68
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,290
One of the most popular of all
the front-end frameworks is of

69
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,980
course Bootstrap.

70
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,000
We'll look at Bootstrap in more
detail In the subsequent lectures.

71
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:52,910
Foundation by Zurb is yet another popular
framework, has a pretty large following.

72
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,460
Then we have Semantic UI which
is gaining a lot of ground.

73
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,403
Pure by Yahoo, UI Kit, and many more.

74
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:07,461
Now, when you look at these frameworks,
you will notice that they have a lot

75
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:12,790
in common, and each one of these
frameworks have some unique features.

76
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:18,105
Now, your choice of a framework is
dictated more by what you're trying

77
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:23,701
to achieve than trying to stick to one
single framework for all your needs.

78
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:28,310
Again, look at it as possibilities
that you have for you.

79
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,750
Getting started with any one of these
frameworks is not that difficult

80
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,990
once you have a quick introduction
to one of those frameworks.

81
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,159
Many of them have common
features as a set.

82
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:45,121
So it should not be very difficult to
switch from one framework to another if

83
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:49,480
you'll find that a second one is
better suited for your purpose.

84
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,841
So now we will go onto the next set
of lectures where we'll examine

85
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,942
Bootstrap in more detail.
