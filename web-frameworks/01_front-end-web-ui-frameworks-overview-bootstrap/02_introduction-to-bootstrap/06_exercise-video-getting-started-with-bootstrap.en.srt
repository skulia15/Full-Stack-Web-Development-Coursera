1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,390
Strap on your boots and let's get started
with our first hands on exercise.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,405
Sorry, just couldn't resist that.

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,450
Okay, let's get started
with the first exercise.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,340
Where we are going to learn how you would
set up a web project to use Bootstrap,

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:25,560
how you would include Bootstrap CSS and
JavaScript classes into a webpage.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,022
And how to apply the Bootstrap classes
to various elements in the webpage,

7
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,852
to design your webpage.

8
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:40,880
First, go to your convenient
location on your computer.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,690
And create a folder named conFusion.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,830
Yes, that's right conFusion.

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,292
That's the name of the website
that we're gonna create.

12
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,827
So let's do that first.

13
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:04,929
Once you create that folder,
let's move into that folder and

14
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:08,040
then we'll download Bootstrap files.

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,382
Next, go to the Bootstrap website,
www.getbootstrap.com, and

16
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:20,485
then download the zip file containing the
Bootstrap CSS JavaScript and font classes.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,890
Then, move the zip file to the folder that
we just created, and then unzip the file.

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,167
This will create a folder
named bootstrap-3.3.5-dtxt.

19
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:42,209
Move into that folder and
move the three folders

20
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,980
inside there into the conFusion folder.

21
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,339
So let's select them and
then move them to the conFusion folder.

22
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,755
Then move back to the conFusion folder and

23
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:02,795
then now you can delete
the Bootstrap distribution files.

24
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:10,850
Now our folder is setup with the Bootstrap
files, to get started on our web project.

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,090
Next, download the index.html
file that we have provided for

26
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,850
you and
then move it to the conFusion folder.

27
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,900
Then, you can open the index.html
file in your favorite browser, and

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,680
then have a look at the contents in there.

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,160
I have already configured this
html file with some content,

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,300
which we're going to style
using the Bootstrap classes.

31
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,320
This project creates a website for
a fictitious restaurant named con Fusion.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,550
When you look at the current
state of the webpage,

33
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,630
it is plain and simple,
with just the content.

34
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,630
Looks like a typical computer
science professor's webpage.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,901
At the end of this module,
we're gonna take this webpage and

36
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:12,308
then use Bootstrap classes to style it,
and turn this webpage into this webpage.

37
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,707
You can see that the content has
been appropriately styled using

38
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:28,270
various Bootstrap classes,
to make it a lot more attractive.

39
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,370
And fun to look at.

40
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,470
So let's get started styling
this webpage using Bootstrap.

41
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,260
I'm going to be using Brackets as the
editor of choice for this set of courses.

42
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,060
You are welcome to use any text id
term that you are familiar with for

43
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,149
editing the files.

44
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:00,510
On the screen, you already see that I have
opened the conFusion folder in Brackets,

45
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,555
and opened the index.html file to
be displayed in the window there.

46
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:10,365
Now, one reason why I
chose to use Brackets,

47
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:15,775
is the availability of the live
preview facility in Brackets.

48
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,785
If you go to the right side of the screen,

49
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:22,515
you see this button,
which looks like a thunderbolt.

50
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:25,815
When you click on that,
Brackets will automatically open

51
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:30,520
that webpage in a browser.

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,270
And whenever you make any changes to
that code, in the webpage in Brackets.

53
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,560
It's automatically going to update
the webpage in the browser.

54
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,130
This is an interesting feature
that makes it easy for

55
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,070
us to see the changes
immediately in a browser.

56
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,160
Now because of the restriction of
the screen, I am not able to show you

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,595
both the browser and
of the Brackets window at the same time,

58
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:05,800
simply because it won't be
very clear in the video.

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,080
So I have my webpage open in my browser in
a separate window, which I'm gonna switch

60
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,290
to occasionally to show you the changes
whenever we edit the file in Brackets.

61
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,190
Let's go into the index.html file, and

62
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,296
then paste this code in
the head of the html file.

63
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:39,290
Now, this code sets up our
webpage to be responsive.

64
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,800
Now, I'm going to explain the details of
this code in the next set of lessons.

65
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,280
For the moment,
I want to put that code into place.

66
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,670
So that our webpage begins being
responsive from the start.

67
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,398
Next after the title in
the head of the webpage,

68
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:05,008
I'm going to add in the lines to
import the Bootstrap CSS files.

69
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:18,947
Finally at the bottom of the page,
just before the end of the body tag,

70
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:24,588
I am going to add in the code
to import the jQuery library and

71
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:27,950
Bootstraps JavaScript plugins.

72
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,490
After we make these changes, let's go and

73
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,440
have a look at our current
state of the webpage.

74
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
Now when you switch to our webpage,

75
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,800
you will already see that
the page has changed subtly.

76
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,340
Their fonts that are being used in
the page to render content, has now been

77
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,090
updated to use the Bootstraps default
fonts, which is Helvetica Neue.

78
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:12,550
We are now going to add a container class
to enclose the content of our webpage.

79
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,060
So switching back to the HTML of the page,

80
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,720
we will now go into the content and
to the first div after the header,

81
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,630
so you can see that in the body of our
webpage, we first have the header.

82
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,997
I'm going to style the header
a little bit later.

83
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:36,796
But, we'll move to the first
div inside the body and

84
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:40,518
then apply the class container to this.

85
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:49,965
After this change, let's go back and
have a look at our webpage.

86
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,780
Switching back to our webpage,
you already see that

87
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,750
the content of a webpage is
enclosed inside a container here.

88
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,970
We'll still have the header and

89
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,980
the footer as tied,
which we're going to do next.

90
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,055
Once we upload the container class
to the content of the webpage.

91
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,340
Inside the content, we are going to
divide the content into multiple rows.

92
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,918
So to do that, for the first inner
div's that we're going to encounter

93
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,437
inside the container, we will apply
the row class to each one of them.

94
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:36,185
So let's go ahead and do that,
and then come back and

95
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:37,943
have a look at the webpage again.

96
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:49,440
We have a total of three rows
in the content of our webpage.

97
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,377
Switching back to our webpage,
let's have a quick look at the change.

98
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:03,425
You won't notice much
change in the webpage.

99
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,545
The content has been
enclosed inside the rows,

100
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,470
but we haven't applied any
other styling to the webpage.

101
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,020
We will now move to the header,

102
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,920
which is the first section
of the body of our webpage.

103
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,633
So to the header, I am going to
apply the class of Jumbotron.

104
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,143
And the first inner div
inside that header,

105
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm going to apply the class container.

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:42,733
And the second inner div and
better apply the class row here.

107
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:45,865
After these changes, let's go back and
have a look at our webpage.

108
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,840
Switching back to our webpage.

109
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,250
We now see that our header has
been styled using a Jumbotron.

110
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,580
So, you can see the light grey
background applied to the Jumbotron.

111
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,480
And you can also see how the content has
been rendered in the head of our webpage.

112
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,145
You can already see the webpage
taking on a good shape.

113
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,160
Finally, let's move to the footer of the
page, and then apply the container class

114
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,860
to the first inner div and the row class
to the second inner div in the footer.

115
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,960
After these changes,
let's have a look at our webpage.

116
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,820
Now you can see that our
footer has also been

117
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,320
brought into the center
part of our webpage.

118
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,780
Having one complete look at the webpage
from the top to the bottom,

119
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,940
you can see the Jumbotron at the top,

120
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,480
then you see that the content has
been enclosed inside a container.

121
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,110
And the footer content has also been
enclosed inside another container.

122
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
This completes this exercise.

123
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,470
So we have now understood, how to set up
our web project to use Bootstrap classes,

124
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:08,860
and we have used some basic classes
from Bootstrap to style our webpage.
