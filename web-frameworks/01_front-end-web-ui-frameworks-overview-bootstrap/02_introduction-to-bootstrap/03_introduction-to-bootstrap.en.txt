Let me now quickly
introduce you to Bootstrap, the front-end UI framework that we're
gonna deal with in this course. Bootstrap, as described
on its own website, says that it is the most popular HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript based framework for developing responsive,
mobile first projects on the web. This is definitely true that
Bootstrap is one of the most widely used frameworks for web design. Now, when you look at the bootstrap
framework itself, it is a framework designed for enabling people to
design websites faster and easier. It provides a lot of interesting HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript based templates. Which you will encounter as
we go through this course. And enables us to design websites
very quickly using these components. And Bootstrap has built-in support for responsive design using
the mobile first approach. We will see in the next few lessons,
how the responsive mobile-first approach of Bootstrap can be
leveraged to design responsive websites. Bootstrap was first released in 2011
by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton. They were Twitter employees
that designed Bootstrap for their own use within the company. And then, later,
decided to make it open source. Currently Bootstrap is in version 3.3.5. 4.0 is already on the horizon,
will be released soon. Bootstrap has maintained backward
compatibility as far as possible, but Bootstrap 3 was a big
step forward in supporting responsive web design in a much better
manner than earlier versions of Bootstrap. So, definitely it is worth considering and worth learning because it was one of
the first comprehensive frameworks that was available for use. So we'll move on to the next lesson, where we will first get familiar with
Bootstrap and how to make use of Bootstrap within our project.
