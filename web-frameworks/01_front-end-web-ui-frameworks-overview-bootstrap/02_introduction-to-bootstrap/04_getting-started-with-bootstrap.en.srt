1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,420
Let us now learn how to get started
using Bootstrap in a web project.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,624
In a exercise that follows this
lecture you will get some hands

3
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:16,340
on experience of using Bootstrap
in a real web project.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,420
To get started using Bootstrap we
have three possible approaches.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,320
First, you can go to the Bootstrap website
and then download the Bootstrap files.

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,115
Second, you can get hold of
the Bootstrap sources In either Less or

7
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:39,065
Sass preprocessor format.

8
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:43,515
We will examine these in more
detail later on in this course.

9
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:48,085
The third alternative for
you is to use the precompiled

10
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:52,620
Bootstrap available through Bootstrap CDN.

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,480
Here, you don't need to download
any files, but instead,

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,560
simply link to the Bootstrap

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,610
files that are available through
a content distribution network site.

14
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,150
We will follow the first approach.

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,970
In the exercise that follows this lecture.

16
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,630
We will go to the Bootstrap site and
then download the Bootstrap files and

17
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,660
then unzip the downloaded zip file
containing the Bootstrap files.

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,970
When you unzip the zip file,
you will find that

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,870
it creates a folder and
subfolders inside the folder.

20
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:36,850
The structure of the Bootstrap folder
is shown on the right side, here.

21
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,810
You have subfolders, CSS that
contains some Bootstrap CSS files.

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,820
Then you have a subfolder named
JS that contains the JavaScript,

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,730
part of the bootstrap sources.

24
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,590
And then you have a subfolder contain,
called fonts,

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,270
which contains fonts that
you use in bootstrap.

26
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,110
We need to include these files
into our Bootstrap project.

27
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,790
How do we get started using
Bootstrap within our project?

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,980
In your HTML5, in the head of your HTML5,

29
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,870
you are required to
include these three lines.

30
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,990
Later on, we will examine what these
three lines do for your project.

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:29,630
Then, you need to input the bootstrap
CSS files into your web page.

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,330
To do that, we will include these two
lines into the head of an HTML page.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,610
Now, we are importing the Bootstrap file
itself and then, the Bootstrap theme

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,870
CSS file into our project
using these two lines.

35
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,954
You notice that I have specified
the files as bootstrap.min.css and

36
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:56,850
bootstrap-theme.min.css.

37
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,770
The minfied format is what we
use when we design our project.

38
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,067
Now if you are editing a Bootstrap or
a CSS file,

39
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:09,950
you will write the CSS
file in normal format.

40
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,190
Then you can strip off all
the unnecessary blank spaces and

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,320
the comments from your CSS file and
then create a minified file.

42
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,220
So, the verified file is
much smaller in size and so

43
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,430
easier for people to download
when they view your web page.

44
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,360
In addition,
Bootstrap also uses Javascript.

45
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,660
Bootstrap makes use of the jQuery
Javascript library for

46
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,830
providing much of its
Javascript functionality.

47
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,360
So Bootstrap has JavaScript plugins

48
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,800
designed using the jQuery
library as the basis.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,770
So that is the reason you need
to include the jQuery library.

50
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:07,068
In addition, you will include
Bootstraps own JavaScript classes,

51
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:13,050
this has to be done just before
the end of the body of your web page.

52
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,467
The primary reason why we include
the JavaScript files towards

53
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:24,696
the end of the body of your web page,
is so that when you view the web page,

54
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:31,575
the web page can be rendered even before
the JavaScript is actually processed.

55
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:36,620
So, when your web page is being rendered
by your browser, it'll first display all

56
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,200
the content and then use JavaScript
to then restyle the content.

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,510
Now, this makes the web page
loading a lot more faster.

58
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,950
As I mentioned earlier,

59
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,060
you can also include Bootstrap
directly from its Bootstrap CDN.

60
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,890
This is the set of lines that you
will include within your HTML

61
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:06,420
page in order to use Bootstrap directly
from the content distribution network.

62
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:13,960
So the first two lines you will include
in the head to import the CSS files.

63
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,511
The last two lines will be included at
the bottom of the body of your HTML

64
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,020
page to import the JavaScript libraries.

65
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,940
Now, when you design a web page, we will
often use a class called as a container

66
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,600
to hold all the contents of our web page.

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,290
The container defines the fixed
width region within your web page.

68
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,640
Inside which the contents will
be displayed for your web page.

69
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,070
So this is one way of restricting
your contents to display in certain

70
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,050
part of the web page.

71
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,330
The container size will
vary depending upon

72
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,260
the size of the screen from which
you are viewing your website.

73
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:11,700
We will deal with the container
more in the next set of lessons.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,960
Normally, we would use
the container as the outermost

75
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,120
div element to wrap
the contents of our website.

76
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,590
This is required in order to make
the Bootstrap grid work correctly.

77
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,380
What exactly is the Bootstrap grid?

78
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,800
That we will deal with in the next

79
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,560
set of lessons where we will
deal with responsive web design.

80
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,100
You can also use another class
card as container fluid to

81
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,510
use a full width container.

82
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:50,180
The container fluid class enables
a full width container window,

83
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,290
which spans the entire
size of your screen.

84
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,375
To understand the container class better,
let me show you a web page.

85
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:07,260
You're going to see this web page
as part of your exercises later.

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,636
Now, within this web page,

87
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:14,487
all the contents in here
are enclosed inside a container so

88
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:19,940
that they will be displayed inside
a fixed region of your screen.

89
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,575
Bootstrap also provides
another class called the row.

90
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:33,470
We use the row class to divide
the page contents into multiple rows.

91
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,280
Each row acts as a horizontal grouping for

92
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,690
information that has to be
displayed in a single group.

93
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,140
A row may contain multiple columns.

94
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,190
We will deal with that in the next lesson.

95
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,500
In Bootstrap, the rows must always
be contained inside containers for

96
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,320
the Bootstrap grid to work correctly.

97
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,330
Another element that we're going to
examine in the exercise is a Jumbotron.

98
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,530
A Jumbotron is a lightweight

99
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,470
Bootstrap component that is used to
showcase key content on your web page.

100
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,890
So for example, this can be used
to show the name of your company,

101
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:26,040
some brief description about your company,
and typically at the top of your page.

102
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,420
When you use a Jumbotron within your
web page, you can use the Jumbotron

103
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,538
outside a container and then include
a container inside a Jumbotron.

104
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:41,266
So that the contents of the Jumbotron
can be within a fixed region

105
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:48,600
of the Jumbotron but this enables your
Jumbotron to span the entire screen width.

106
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,430
Returning to our web page example,

107
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,025
the top blue region is
using a Jumbotron and

108
00:08:57,025 --> 00:09:03,420
inside that we are displaying
the contents of our website.

109
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,780
The name and
some brief description of the website.

110
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,830
Now, we will move on to our
first hands on exercise

111
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,550
where you will use the classes
the you just encountered.

112
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,690
You will start by including
Boostrap into your HTML page and

113
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,110
then we will use the container and

114
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,160
the rule classes to
structure our web page and

115
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,532
we also see the use of
Jumbotron within our web page.
