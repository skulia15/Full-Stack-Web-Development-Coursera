   <p>
    <strong>
     Text editor of your choice
    </strong>
    : Any text editor that you are already familiar with can be used for editing the project files. I will be using Brackets (
    <a href="http://brackets.io/">
     http://brackets.io/
    </a>
    ) as the editor. You may also consider using Sublime Text (
    <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/)">
     http://www.sublimetext.com/)
    </a>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Browser of your choice
    </strong>
    : You may use your preferred browser. I will be using Chrome as the browser in all the exercises. All the exercises and assignments in this course have been tested using Chrome v. 46. Please note that not all browsers may support all the HTML5 features to the same extent. You might encounter problems when using other browsers. I strongly urge you to use the latest Chrome browser for the exercises and assignments in this course so that any problems are minimized.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Command line shell
    </strong>
    : Familiarity with the command line shell will be essential for the exercises. In Windows a cmd window or power shell with admin privileges would be needed. On a Mac or in Linux, a terminal window can be used. Please get familiar with the "sudo" command in OS X and Linux.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Files required for the exercises
    </strong>
    : We will provide additional starter files for the exercises. Links to download the files will be provided inline in the exercise instructions (reading). The links are also available through the Resources (reading) of the specific lesson.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h3 level="3">
  Note: Please remember to retain the folders and all the files that you create in the exercises. Further exercises will build upon the files that you create in the preceding exercises. DO NOT DELETE the files at the end of the exercises, unless otherwise instructed.
