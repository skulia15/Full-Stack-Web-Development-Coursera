00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,170
What is Full Stack Web Development?

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,740
Let me start by clarifying a few terms, so

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,650
that we start with a common
understanding about this area.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,110
First, we hear people talking
about Front end and Back end, or

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,200
sometimes the Client-side and
the Server-side.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,530
Now when we talk about Front end
we are primarily talking about

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,790
presenting the data to the users.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,610
So this is where the users access
the web through the browser.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,630
And so we would be using
technologies like HTML, CSS and

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,189
JavaScript to target the end users.

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,460
The Back end is more concerned with the
business logic and the data aspect of our

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,759
web application, so this might be
implemented in one of several languages.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,490
We often hear people talking about
the Three Tier Architecture for

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,460
web development and implementation.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,640
Now in this approach, which is a common
client-server software architecture

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,930
pattern, the entire development
is divided into three layers.

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,080
The Presentation layer, which is
concerned with the UI related issues and

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,060
how to present the data to the end-user.

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,650
Then we have the Business Logic layer,
which is more concerned with

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,270
data validation and processing the data

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,940
in order to generate information for
the users.

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,660
And then we have the Data Access layer,

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,060
which deals with data persistence and

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,680
storage of data behind the scenes,
for example, in a database.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,730
Exploring this further,
let's look at what is

26
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,790
implemented in each of these
three layers in more detail.

27
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,940
Now, the Business Logic layer is
typically implemented, traditionally,

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:12,566
in a server,
where we use languages like Ruby, Python,

29
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:18,600
C++, Java, on ASP.net,
to implement a server.

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,320
This server in turn, is talking to
a Back end database management system

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,780
to exchange data and
in turn, will be generating

32
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,130
the Front end display of data to the user

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,900
by Server-side rendering of the HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,060
This has been the traditional
approach that

35
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,360
that has been used successfully
in the development.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,085
Now in this approach, we need specialists
in each of these three layers.

37
00:02:56,085 --> 00:03:01,010
So, you have a Front end specialist
who would be well versed in HTML, CSS,

38
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,320
and JavaScript.

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,710
And then you have
the Back end specialists,

40
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,600
one who would be well-versed in
Server-side implementations, say, for

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,540
example, one of the languages used for
Server-side implementation.

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,710
And then you would have a data specialist
who would be mostly concerned with

43
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:24,830
the databases and data persistence
aspect of our web development.

44
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,350
There is an increasing trend towards
Full Stack Web Development where

45
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,920
a single language is used for
implementation over the entire stack.

46
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,210
So you could be having the front
implemented as a single page application,

47
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,900
using one of the JavaScript
frameworks like AngularJS.

48
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,880
Then the Server-side could be implemented
using technologies like NodeJS and

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,180
NodeJS modules, which again,
depends on JavaScript.

50
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,410
And then, the Data Access or
data storage part implemented using

51
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,800
Technologies like MongoDB,
which works based on storing JSON data,

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,100
and serving up information
in the form of JSON data.

53
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,560
Now, JSON has become
the standard format for

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,030
data interchange among the three layers.

55
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,060
Server side increasingly
is delivering a REST API,

56
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,680
so that you can target multiple
platforms through the REST API.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,240
So, essentially, the server is
serving up data in the form of JSON,

58
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,310
which can then be rendered either
on a standard web browser, or

59
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,070
on a mobile device using
one of the multiplied form,

60
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,850
hybrid mobile application
development environments.

61
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,500
So, in this particular specialization
we are targeting the entire stack.

62
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,740
We'll look at HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript and

63
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,100
then we will look at web UI
development using Bootstrap.

64
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:18,030
Then we'll look at Front end
JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS.

65
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,480
Then we'll look at NodeJS and
NodeJS Modules, and

66
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,430
also review Back end as a service,
and also review

67
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,920
data support through
MongoDB on the Server side.
