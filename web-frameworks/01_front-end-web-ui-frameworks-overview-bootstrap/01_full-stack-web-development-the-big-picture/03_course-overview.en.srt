1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,180
As you begin this course
you must be wondering,

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,330
what exactly will be
covered in this course?

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,360
I am now going to explain to you
exactly what we are going to deal with

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,530
in this course, and how it is positioned
in the bigger scheme of things

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,440
in this full stack web
development specialization.

6
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:32,864
Going back to our picture of the full
stack web development specialization,

7
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:36,713
we are now still dealing with
the front end development.

8
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:39,123
And in particular, in this course,

9
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:43,650
we're gonna concentrate on the UI
framework, which is bootstrap.

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,128
So in this scheme, this is the module
dealing with the bootstrap

11
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:55,100
on the front-end side,
the presentation layer side.

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,840
In this course, we are going to
cover bootstrap in a lot of detail.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,643
We'll also introduce you to web tools,

14
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:11,048
in particular Node.js and NPM, and Bower.

15
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:16,713
The remaining web tools we
will see in the next course.

16
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:23,462
This course itself,
is organized into four modules,

17
00:01:23,462 --> 00:01:27,430
each module corresponding
to one week of work.

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,400
In the first module we'll give
you the big picture view of

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,720
Full Stack Web Development,
then we'll introduce you to Bootstrap.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,390
Then we'll talk about the responsive web
design, and the Bootstrap grid system.

21
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,440
We'll also look at an important component
in Bootstrap, which is the navigation bar.

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,520
And at the end of this module,
you will have your first assignment.

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,260
As you go through this course, you will
be building up a website to help you to

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,460
consolidate all the knowledge that
you are acquiring in this course.

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,250
In the second module we will be dealing
with Bootstrap's CSS components.

26
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,173
These components are pure CSS components,

27
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:23,365
which means that they don't need
JavaScript for them to work.

28
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:29,520
In particular, we'll look at user input
components, like buttons and forms.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,140
Then we'll look at displaying content,
using tables, panels and wells.

30
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,230
Then we'll move on to image and
media, dealing with images,

31
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,500
thumbnails and media objects that
are included in your webpage.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,840
Then we'll look at alerting users
by using things like labels,

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,230
badges, alerts and progress bars.

34
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,310
At the end of the second module
you'll have the second assignment 2.

35
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,250
The third module deals

36
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,020
exclusively with Bootstrap's JavaScript
supported components.

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,980
So we'll look at the overview of
Bootstrap's JavaScript components, and

38
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,080
we'll explore tabs, pills,
and tabbed navigation.

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,900
Then we'll look at collapse,
accordion, ScrollSpy, and Affix.

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,860
Then, we look at Tooltips,
Popovers and Modals.

41
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,305
This pretty much covers all
the JavaScript components.

42
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:36,300
We'll also look at Carousel as
an important component there.

43
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,260
At the end of this module,
we'll have assignment 3 due.

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,700
The final module rounds out our discussion
on bootstrap JavaScript competence,

45
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,300
by dealing with Bootstrap and
jQuery, and how they work together.

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,560
And we'll also see how Bootstrap's
JavaScript competence can be controlled

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,740
through the JavaScript methods that
are available for this competence.

48
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,060
Then we'll look at Node.js and
Node Package Manager.

49
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,060
We'll also look at CSS preprocessors,
Less and Sass.

50
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,232
Then we'll encounter our first web tool,
which is Bower.

51
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:24,177
At the end of this module,
you'll have assignment 4.

52
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,430
This completes this course.

53
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,810
I hope you have a good time
going through this course and

54
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,180
take the maximum benefit out of
learning the material in this course.

55
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,996
This course will set
up the foundation upon

56
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:48,131
which we'll build in
the following courses.
