1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,960
As you go through the course you must
be wondering how to make the best

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,460
use of the learning resources
that are available to you.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,200
Let me take you through a quick journey

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,440
of the learning resources that are
available to you within this course, and

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,910
how you can maximize the benefit from
making use of these learning resources.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,640
The course content itself is
organized into multiple modules.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,530
A module has an overarching theme that
guides the content within that module.

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,260
A module itself is organized
into several lectures.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,740
At the end of each module,
you will have an assignment that is due.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,500
Now, when you look at
the organization of the content,

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,300
typically a module corresponds
to one calendar week of work.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,240
When you look at a typical
lecture within a module,

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,510
a lecture will be organized
into several parts.

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,060
At the beginning of the lecture,
you will have objectives and

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,730
outcomes that are clearly specified.

16
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,680
Thereafter, there will be
an introduction to some concepts and

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,970
technologies that are related
to that particular lecture.

18
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,180
Then it is followed by a review quiz.

19
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,730
After that you will have a hands on
exercise where you will practice

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,920
what you've just learned.

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,870
And then finally, we will provide you with
a set of additional resources that you can

22
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,600
follow through in order to further enhance
your understanding of the subject.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,490
To help us understand this more
concretely, let's pay a visit to

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,390
your course website and then have a look
at the contents that are available there.

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,687
So as you can see the course website,

26
00:01:55,687 --> 00:02:00,844
the course content is organized
under this section here.

27
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:05,670
You will see that the course
content is organized into weeks.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,880
Each week corresponds to a module of work.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,290
Now, when you go into a particular week,
when you select a week,

30
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,810
you would notice that the week
itself is organized into a set of

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,490
lectures with a common theme for
the lectures.

32
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,920
The whole module itself
has a common overarching

33
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,300
theme that guides
the design of the module.

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,560
As an example, let's take a look at
this lecture on responsive design and

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,310
Bootstrap grid system.

36
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,000
As you enter the lecture,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,350
it will start out with the objectives and
outcomes for this lecture.

38
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,840
I would strongly suggest that
you read through this document

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,730
in order to understand what you're
going to encounter in this lecture and

40
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,470
what are the outcomes at
the end of this lecture.

41
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,610
So at the completion of this
lecture set you should be able

42
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,730
to do all the outcomes that
are listed in this document.

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,690
Following this, you will see a set of
lectures that are available to you.

44
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:20,190
So you can watch all of these lectures and
then after that, you will move on to

45
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,848
a hands-on exercise that
will be delivered to you.

46
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,690
So, the hands-on exercise
is delivered in two parts.

47
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,060
One, So we have a video of

48
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:44,370
the exercise itself, guiding you
through every step of the exercise.

49
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,280
You also have a written document
that contains the instructions for

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,370
the exercise.

51
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,260
So, you should be watching the video

52
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,440
in order to understand how
the exercise progresses.

53
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,910
I will be explaining in
more detail in the video.

54
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,700
But also together with that,
you have this written document

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,120
where I have given the step by
step exercise instructions.

56
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,410
So you can follow through and

57
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,070
even the source code that I am using
in the exercises are available to you.

58
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,410
So in case you decide to cut and
paste the source code,

59
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:27,490
you can always obtain the source code
right here within this written document.

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,432
At the end of the hands on exercise
you will have a quiz that will help

61
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:39,370
you to review the concepts that you
have just seen in this lecture.

62
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,650
And at the end of each lecture we also
have a set of additional resources.

63
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,850
These are pointers to further
reading that you can pursue

64
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,510
in order to enhance what
you have just learned.

65
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,060
It's completely voluntary.

66
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,990
You can find some these to
be very informative for

67
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,430
you to read in your own spare time.

68
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,330
So to summarize the learning resources
that are available to you within this

69
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,520
course include video lectures,
then we have practice quizzes,

70
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,150
then hands on exercise, both in the video
format as well as written instructions.

71
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,790
And I would again remind you that
you should be watching the video of

72
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,870
the exercise in order to understand how
the exercise progresses step by step, and

73
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,000
then pointers to additional resources.

74
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,724
The reason the learning resources
are organized the way they

75
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:47,139
are is that the best way to learn is
not just focus on the concepts but

76
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,751
also have hands-on practice so

77
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:54,620
that it reinforces your
understanding of the concepts.

78
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,020
So that is why we have
the hands-on exercises following

79
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,560
the introduction to the concepts and
the technologies.

80
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,820
Now this is where I would remind you of
the traditional Chinese proverb which

81
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,360
says that what I hear, I forget, what I
see, I remember, what I do, I understand.

82
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,070
So let me again emphasize the importance
of going through the hands-on exercises.

83
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,510
That is the only way you will
completely understand the concepts and

84
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,220
technologies that we cover in this course.

85
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,690
Another related point that I wanted to
remind is from another proverb which says,

86
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,550
he who learns does not think is lost,
he who thinks but

87
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,099
does not learn is in great danger.

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,090
Or rather, learning without
thinking begets ignorance.

89
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,850
Thinking without learning
is very dangerous.

90
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:58,573
Now, this is where let me emphasize
that as you go through the concepts and

91
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:03,670
the technologies, and
as you do the hands on exercise,

92
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,102
ask yourself the question,
why are you doing these steps.

93
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:13,753
What exactly is it intended to convey
to you and what is the reason for

94
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:17,770
doing the steps the way
they are being done?

95
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,630
That is the only way you will completely
understand what you're going through.

96
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,760
It is very easy to go through
this sort of exercises and

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,360
concepts without thinking and at the end
you will end up learning nothing.

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,030
Similarly, if you just skip
all the learning part and

99
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,590
assumed that you've learned everything
then that is equally as dangerous.

100
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,960
So please, spare some time to think
as you learn and to understand.

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,480
We always have the discussion
forums where any questions

102
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,470
related to the materials can
be clarified in more detail.

103
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,556
I hope you have a very good learning
experience as you go through this course.
