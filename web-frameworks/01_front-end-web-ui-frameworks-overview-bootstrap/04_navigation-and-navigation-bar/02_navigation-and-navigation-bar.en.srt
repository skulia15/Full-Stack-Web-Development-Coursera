1
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:05,730
Let's now talk about navigation.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,910
What is navigation?

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,620
Why is it important in
the context of websites?

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,940
And how do we provide navigation
within our website hierarchy for

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,640
visitors to our website?

6
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:24,284
When we look at many websites out there,

7
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:29,269
we immediately realize that most
websites are not single pages.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,570
Of course, you do see occasional
single-page websites, too.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,760
But in general, most websites
typically consist of multiple pages.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,240
And so when a visitor comes to your
main web page, typically indexed .html,

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,250
they might also need to navigate to
other pages within your website.

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:58,080
And when they do so, you should have a way
of indicating to them which other pages

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,660
are there on your website, and
also if they move to another page,

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,558
where they are within your web page
hierarchy on your website, and

15
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:16,000
also an easy way of returning to
the main page of your website.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,780
All these features can be provided
through various navigational

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,700
aids that you can build
into your websites.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,700
Now there are several commonly
used navigation patterns

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,270
that are used extensively
on most websites.

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,190
In particular,
navigation bar is an easy way of providing

21
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,570
the user with access to
the hierarchy of a website.

22
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:49,025
When you think about website navigation,
one of the important features that you

23
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:53,535
should consider is the information
architecture that you use in your website.

24
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:56,095
What exactly is information architecture?

25
00:01:56,095 --> 00:02:00,092
This has to deal with the organization,
the labeling,

26
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:05,142
and the appropriate navigation
methods that you provide through

27
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:10,240
the information that is
available on your website.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Now, information architecture
design is a whole field in itself.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,790
And that is beyond
the scope of this course.

30
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,170
But I have provided you with some
additional links in the resources,

31
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,860
where you can go and explore more
details about information architecture.

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,143
In particular,
we need to consider information

33
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:32,587
architecture when we
are designing websites, and

34
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:38,126
that also suggests what kind of navigation
we should provide within our website.

35
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:45,230
Typically, websites are organized in
some kind of a hierarchical fashion.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,620
You have a top level page from
which you might have subpages.

37
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,950
And from those, you can go into
further down in the hierarchy.

38
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,910
You might even have,
within a single layer,

39
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,440
cross navigation between different
entities within that layer.

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,420
So, any navigation scheme that you
design should be able to accommodate all

41
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,760
these different patterns of
access to these different

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,600
objects of information
within your web page.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,080
In general,
most websites will have a navigation bar

44
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,250
designed and available within
the web pages of the website.

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,420
The navigation bar is typically
shown either at the top or

46
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,960
at the bottom of the website.

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,740
Sometimes it will be fixed in location,
either the top or

48
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,250
the bottom of the window,
which is displaying the web page.

49
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,920
Whatever be the case, a navigation bar
has become a de facto standard for

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,500
providing a way of informing a visitor

51
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,250
about various pages that
are available within your website and

52
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,170
how you can navigate from one to another.

53
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,880
In addition, within the navigation bar,
you might also indicate

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,790
where the user currently
is within this hierarchy.

55
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,960
Taking a look at your own course website,

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,110
you will see the provision of a navigation
bar within the course website.

57
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,050
In this case,
it is provided more like a sidebar.

58
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,310
So you can see that on the left-hand side,

59
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,100
you have information like where
you are currently at the moment.

60
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,110
And so for example, right now,
we are on the Course Info page of

61
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,380
our course website.

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,370
There are a few suggestions on how
to design a good navigation bar.

63
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,788
Here, I have a small list of them.

64
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:54,080
Of course, non-exhaustive list, so
you might have more things to consider

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,160
when you are actually applying
a navigation bar to your own website.

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,068
But when you design navigation,
you should typically provide

67
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:09,170
user-friendly terms, but
list it within your navigation bar.

68
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,900
And also,
you have to standardize the navigation.

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,600
So no matter which page
they user is at the moment,

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,140
they will still be able to navigate to
any other location within your website.

71
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,870
And also,

72
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,830
some way of identifying where within
the hierarchy the user currently is.

73
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:38,130
So you might highlight the current page
that the user is viewing in the navigation

74
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,470
bar, so that it's easy for them to see
where they are within the hierarchy.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,990
There are some standard web
conventions that people use when they

76
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,620
design navigation bars.

77
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,900
One such convention that
has been widely adopted

78
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,520
is that if you put a logo of your
website in your navigation bar,

79
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,260
clicking on that logo will typically take
you back to the home page of that website.

80
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,280
Now, some things that you
should definitely avoid

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,390
is to have too many items
in your navigation bar.

82
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,410
How many is too many?

83
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,990
If you find it difficult to
use your navigation bar, well,

84
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,195
that is always already too many.

85
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:23,615
It is better to have a smaller subset,

86
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:28,805
targeted subset,
of links within your navigation bar.

87
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,617
Meaningful links,
within your navigation bar.

88
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:36,377
Again, this is a choice of taste for
different people that have different

89
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:41,817
criteria for considering what should and
should not be in the navigation bar.

90
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:46,010
And also depending on the specific
website that has been designed.

91
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,240
One other thing that you should think
about is to avoid generic labels.

92
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,700
Things like if you put a product there.

93
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,900
What does a product mean?

94
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,540
Or a service there.

95
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,160
What kind of service
are you talking about?

96
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,290
It is better to customize
those labels to specific

97
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,990
items that you are providing
within your website.

98
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,280
Another commonly used pattern for

99
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,850
providing navigational information within
a website is what we call as a breadcrumb.

100
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:26,060
If you have noticed on many websites,
at the top, you might see a set of

101
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,100
links being indicated with
pointers to sublinks.

102
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:39,260
And the current page that you are on might
be highlighted in that set of links.

103
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,410
Clicking on any one of those earlier links
will take you back within the hierarchy.

104
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,337
So, in some sense,
the breadcrumbs sort of also

105
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:54,513
reflects some kind of
a structure of your web page.

106
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:57,820
Now, there are many different
ways of designing breadcrumbs.

107
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,390
If you have a website where people
are going through a step-by-step process,

108
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,820
say, for example, purchasing an airline
ticket, the breadcrumbs might indicate

109
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,370
the current sequence within the entire set
of steps that the user is at the moment.

110
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,800
Or if you have a e-commerce website,
you might have a current sequence of steps

111
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,300
in order to order an item or
a set of items from that company.

112
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,700
So you might indicate, for example,
whether the user is currently in

113
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,380
the selection process of the items, or the
user is in the payment process, and so on.

114
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,010
So, that is what we have addressed,

115
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,700
path based navigation support
within the breadcrumbs.

116
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,473
The second approach would be to
provide a location based information

117
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:51,920
within the breadcrumb hierarchy.

118
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,870
A third alternative that you
might have seen in some websites,

119
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,700
where the breadcrumbs are not actually
indicated as a linear sequence but

120
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,950
more like a set of choices, maybe where
you have several set of attributes related

121
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,975
to the items that you might be
selecting on an e-commerce website.

122
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:18,920
Say, for example, a price range,
the color, or the size,

123
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,150
or the type, or maybe the manufacturer's
information, and so on.

124
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,360
So those kind of things that
can also form information that

125
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
could be characterized under breadcrumbs.

126
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,940
Let's take an example of
your own course website

127
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,390
to see how breadcrumbs
are being used there.

128
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,500
For example,
when you visit your own course page,

129
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,040
as you are going through the various items

130
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,608
in the course content,
you would notice on the top

131
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:06,810
a breadcrumb based navigation
that is already provided for you.

132
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,040
In there, we have the upper level links

133
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,800
being shown in the breadcrumbs as
links and the current location

134
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,820
being shown just by information,
and it is not a link, but

135
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,640
just identifying where you
are currently in the hierarchy.

136
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,190
There are several other navigation
aids that are used in practice.

137
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,410
These include tabs, pills, pagination.

138
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,970
Especially when you have a lot of
information to be shown to a user,

139
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,980
you might actually subdivide
it into pages, and

140
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,850
then let the user access
the information page by page.

141
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,260
So you would provide some kind of
pagination support at either the top or

142
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,095
the bottom of the page of
information that you are displaying.

143
00:10:57,095 --> 00:11:02,331
We have dropdowns, accordions, tags,

144
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:07,727
Scrollspy, and Affix, and many others.

145
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:12,289
We will look at some of these
in more details in subsequent

146
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:14,295
modules of this course.
