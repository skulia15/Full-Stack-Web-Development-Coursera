1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:08,120
Let us now talk about Bootstraps
own support for navigation.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,380
In particular, in this lecture,
we will talk about the Bootstrap's Navbar.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,240
Navbar is a very easy

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,780
way of providing navigational
information within your website.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,661
Let's look at the details next.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,314
As I already mentioned,

7
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:34,060
the Navbar is a way of easily
providing navigation for your website.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,330
The Navbar typically appears
at the top of the page or

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,280
the bottom of the page depending
upon the design of your website.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,070
Now, Navbars can also
support responsive features,

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,140
meaning that when you're viewing
the website on a extra small screen.

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,010
Maybe you may wish to
collapse the Navbar and

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,330
only display content by toggling
the information appropriately.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,260
For larger screen sizes,

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,788
it is probably more easier to accommodate
a full fledged navigation bar.

16
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:13,230
So we will look at bootstrap support for
both situations in more detail next.

17
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,650
Let's talk in particular, about a simple
navigation bar that can be provided

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,780
within bootstrap and
how we go about configuring it.

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,210
So here I have an example of
a simple navigation bar and

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,360
the corresponding code that is used in
Bootstrap to design this navigation bar.

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,470
Now I am leveraging the Nav HTML
element to design my navigation bar.

22
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,670
To this nav HTML element, I am using

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,390
the Navbar classes that
are available as part of Bootstrap.

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:01,260
The Navbar, which turns that HTML element
into a Navbar and the Navbar default.

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,976
So this is the default structuring of
the navigation bar in Bootstrap or

26
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,106
the default coloring and so on.

27
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:12,439
Also notice that I am declaring
that this Navbar takes

28
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,810
on the role of providing
navigation within this website.

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,500
Now let's look at the example
Navbar on the screen and

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,040
then see how this is actually constructed
by using the HTML code below there.

31
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,380
In particular, you see that the list
of items being displayed in

32
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,130
the Navbar is declared in
the code as an unsorted list

33
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,850
with the class nav navbar-nav.

34
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,400
And within these each list
item is displayed using li and

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,650
then you provide the href through
the normal HTML links there.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,776
One particular list item has been
identified as the active list item there.

37
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:09,490
So for this example, I have identified
the Home as the active list item.

38
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,820
What this means is that in the Bootstrap's
Navbar, this Home item is highlighted

39
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,660
with a darker color for the default
Navbar as you can see on the screen.

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:29,220
I am now extending the Navbar
into Into adding more features.

41
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,180
One, is that I am adding in what
we call as a brand to the navbar.

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,230
So within the Navbar on the left side,

43
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,830
you can see the name of
the website being displayed there.

44
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,830
That name will form part
of the Navbar header.

45
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,280
And inside the navbar header,
which is a separate div there,

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,370
I am declaring a class called
navbar-brand to a link and

47
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,980
then I am providing that link there.

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,220
Now you can replace the text
within that link by

49
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,970
an actual image which might
be the logo of your website.

50
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,855
So that's another way of providing
navigation within the navbar,

51
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,090
specifically using the logo navigation.

52
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,300
Typically, when you put the logo into the
navbar, users expect that when they click

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,640
on that logo, they are going to be taken
back to the home page of the navbar.

54
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,280
So when you specify the href for

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,360
that class there, you should make sure
that it is identifying your home page.

56
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,180
We can also similarly put
items to the right side,

57
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,020
right into the screen within the navbar.

58
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,260
To do that,
we are going to use the nav navbar-nav for

59
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,060
the unsorted list that we've seen already.

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,950
In addition, we're going to supply
another attribute called navbar-right.

61
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,719
When you specify that,

62
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:08,130
there are list items that are gonna be
put on the right edge of the navbar.

63
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,224
For left edge you, would say navbar-left,
for right edge you would say navbar-right.

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,830
We can make the navbar also responsive.

65
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,490
Meaning that when you are viewing
the website on an extra small screen or

66
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,230
any chosen size of the screen.

67
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,920
You can collapse the navbar and
hide the items within the navbar.

68
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,740
And instead replace it with a toggle
button as you see in the picture here.

69
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,800
When the user clicks on the toggle button,
then you will expand the navigation

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,800
bar to show the link items, like so.

71
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,370
When the user again clicks
on the toggle button,

72
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,178
you're going to hide
those navigation items.

73
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:58,493
So this behavior can easily
be supported within Bootstrap

74
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:03,916
using the toggle button that
can be included in the header,

75
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,750
nav-navbar header of your Bootstrap.

76
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,240
We will see how that is
done in the next slide.

77
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,900
Now we are going to examine how
to design this responsive navbar.

78
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,400
First, we need a toggle
button within the navbar.

79
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,740
So this is usually included in the
navbar-header as shown by the code here.

80
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,110
So in here, I am declaring a button type.

81
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:39,550
And the class I am using is navbar-toggle
and also specified as collapsed.

82
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,310
Meaning that the items that this Button is
referring to will be in the collapsed mode

83
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,440
when you are viewing this page
on an extra small device.

84
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,070
When the user clicks on this button,
then the further

85
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:07,110
details are the extended navbar will
be toggled and shown on the screen.

86
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,890
Now this is implemented
by enclosing the items

87
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:18,150
within the list inside a div and
giving it an id.

88
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,670
This id in this example,
the id given is navbar and

89
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,840
that id is used as a data target for
the button.

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,805
What exactly is a data target and
how is it used?

91
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:34,175
For that,
we need to understand that JavaScript

92
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:39,235
modules that were
implemented in Bootstrap.

93
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:44,592
So I'm going to come back to refer
to this one more time in the module

94
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:48,628
where we look at JavaScript
within Bootstrap.

95
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:54,242
But here, let's understand that

96
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:59,682
this id is also used to specify
the data target for the button.

97
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:02,562
Meaning that that button
is going to toggle on and

98
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:07,410
off, whatever is inside
this div on the screen.

99
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,520
Now for this div in addition,

100
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,408
I'm going to give the class as
navbar collapse and collapse.

101
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:18,600
Meaning that initially
when you are viewing this

102
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,640
page on an extra small screen,
the navbar will start out collapsed.

103
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:29,410
When the user clicks on the button, then
the navbar will be toggled and vice versa.

104
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,270
Some additional configurations
that you can give for navbars,

105
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,230
include specifying that the navbar
should be fixed to the top of the page.

106
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,300
Meaning that the navbar is always visible
and will be fixed at the top of the page.

107
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,230
The content will scroll, but the navbar
will remain fixed in that location.

108
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,990
You can also similarly fix
the navbar at the bottom.

109
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,168
The corresponding classes
are indicated here.

110
00:08:56,168 --> 00:09:00,200
.Navbar-fixed-top and
.navbar-fixed-bottom.

111
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,941
There are other specification that
you can give is to specify the navbar

112
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,380
as navbar-static-top.

113
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,550
Meaning that this navbar will
be at the top of the page, but

114
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,488
will scroll when you scroll the page.

115
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:16,940
So the navbar will disappear from
the screen when you scroll the page up.

116
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,220
In Bootstrap, earlier we saw that we
declared the navbar as navbar default.

117
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,300
The default navbar for bootstrap
is a light colored navigation bar.

118
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,500
You can also have a dark colored
navigation bar in bootstrap by providing

119
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,830
the class as navbar-inverse
instead of navbar-default.

120
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,840
So in the navbar-inverse, the background
of the navbar will be dark in color but

121
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,880
the text will be lighter in color.

122
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,500
One last addition to
the navbar that is often used,

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,580
is what we refer to as a dropdown.

124
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,000
When we talk about a dropdown,

125
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,050
any item within the navbar can
be turned into a dropdown.

126
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,315
So that when the user clicks on the item,
then you would display

127
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:13,270
a list of dropdown

128
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,100
items to the user and then allow them
to select one of those dropdown items.

129
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,070
Similarly, when you click
on the item in the navbar,

130
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,950
then we will hide this dropdown, right?

131
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,000
So this toggling of this
dropdown list of items is done

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,460
by clicking on the item inside the navbar.

133
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,542
In this example, if you click
on the Menu item in the navbar,

134
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:44,040
it will display the detailed list there.

135
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,521
If you click on it again,
then that detail list will disappear.

136
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:54,140
So this is the use of dropdowns in navbar.

137
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,170
How do we implement it?

138
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,110
We'll examine that next.

139
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:07,330
So to implement the dropdown,
we need to Declared the drop down

140
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,800
as a list item within
the unsorted list that we used

141
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,785
to construct the navbar links there.

142
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:24,665
Now one of the items will be declared
as a list item of the type dropdown.

143
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:27,995
The code on the left side indicates

144
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:31,720
how you would declare
the list item as a dropdown.

145
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,700
And in addition, you specify the class

146
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,100
as dropdown-toggle and

147
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,740
the data would be specified at dropdown,
data-toggle as dropdown.

148
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,150
And some additional rows there and

149
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,240
in particular, notice that
declaration of the span class caret.

150
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,860
Now this is used to show
these inverted triangle

151
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,325
next to the item within the bar.

152
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,280
To indicate that when
the user clicks on that item,

153
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,575
we're ging to show a dropdown list there.

154
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:15,325
Now how do we declare the items
within the dropdown list?

155
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:21,672
That will be included as another
unsorted list inside this list item.

156
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:28,742
And this unsorted list shown on the right
side has the class dropdown menu.

157
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:32,940
And individual list items
listed there will be shown in

158
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,450
the list of items in the dropdown menu.

159
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,040
So you can see that these list
items correspond with Appetizers,

160
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,860
Main Courses and so on.

161
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,980
You can also include a separator by
declaring the role as a separator and

162
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,610
the class as a divider for
one of the list items.

163
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,200
You can also have a header there

164
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,920
by declaring a list item with
a class dropdown-header.

165
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,510
So that that will not be treated as
a link, instead it will be treated as

166
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,440
just a header for
the items displayed below.

167
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,370
So this is yet another feature that
we will use within the navbar.

168
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,980
This completes our discussion
on Bootstrap Navbar.

169
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,440
In the exercise that follows, we are going
to design a navbar for our webpage.

170
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:33,835
At the end of the exercise, you will
see our webpage having a fixed top

171
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:40,330
navbar as shown in
the website details here.

172
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:48,210
And this navbar is colored
appropriately for our website.

173
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:54,078
We'll see how we can do that
using the CSS class and

174
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,549
we also see a dropdown
item within the navbar.
