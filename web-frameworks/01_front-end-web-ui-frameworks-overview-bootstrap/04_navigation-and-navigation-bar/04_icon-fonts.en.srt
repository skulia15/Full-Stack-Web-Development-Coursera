1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,870
Let me now give you quick
overview of icon fonts,

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,710
what are they,
how are they used on websites, and

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,879
what advantages do they bring when
you use them within your websites.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,600
Icon fonts are a set of icons and cliffs.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,130
They can be used just like
regular font on your website so

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,560
just like you use your standard
alphabets on your website,

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,340
you can use icon fonts in any
location on your website.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:43,460
The advantages that icon fonts bring is
that they can be easily styled using CSS.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,300
Which means you can control the color,
size and background and

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,540
many other features of
icon fonts using CSS.

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:59,880
Icon fonts are a very light weight
replacement for graphics on your webpages.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,400
So if you have simple graphics,
instead of using images,

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,970
you can use icon fonts as
an easy replacement for them.

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,230
Now when your web site
includes icon fonts,

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,280
they are downloaded
without needing additional

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,390
requests being sent to your web site
in order to download the images.

17
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,660
So that's one of the advantages why icon
fonts have gained a lot of popularity

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,480
in usage on websites.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:38,150
Many different icon fonts are available
that are used by website designers.

20
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,030
To help us understand how icon
fonts are used in websites,

21
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,830
let's quickly visit your
course web page itself.

22
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,650
Now, on the left side in the side bar,

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,090
you can see that we have
a list of links there.

24
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,770
In addition to the links,
to the left side of the links,

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:02,180
we also have small graphical
icons included in the web page.

26
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,850
All these icons have been
created using icon fonts.

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,130
Let's take a look at few example
icon fonts that are used.

28
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,320
In particular, in this course,
I'm gonna make you use of the Glyphicons.

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,870
Glyphicons are already included as
part of the Bootstrap framework.

30
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,080
In addition,

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,810
I'm going to make use of Font Awesome,
which is another popular icon font.

32
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,480
As I mentioned, Glyphicons
are already included in Bootstrap.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,490
To make use of Glyphicons, on any location
in your webpage, you use the span tag.

34
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,340
To the span tag you will give
a class as glyphicon and

35
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,280
then the specific class for the icon
that you are using at the location.

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,260
So in this example you see me using the
Glyphicon home as the second class there.

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,360
Glyphicon home corresponds to
the home icon in the glyphicon set.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,130
Glyphicons included in Bootstrap
are about 250 in number.

39
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,760
Another popular icon
font that I mentioned,

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
that we will make use of in this course,
is Font Awesome.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,590
Now Font Awesome includes
a large set of icons.

42
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,180
And provide you with a large variety of
icons that you can use on your website.

43
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,020
Now once you take a look at Font Awesome
you're gonna say, awesome man.

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,600
Okay, okay, okay.

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,780
You can laugh as much as you want.

46
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,563
I am definitely not going to
pretend to be a teenager.

47
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,570
Okay coming back to icon fonts.

48
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,380
They way you use icon fonts on
your website, Is to use the i tag.

49
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,290
To the i tag, you would give
a class as fa and then fa hyphen

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,190
the specific icon that you're
using at that location.

51
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,153
So in this example, you see me using
fa fa phone, meaning the phone icon

52
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:11,810
will be substituted in that
particular location on your webpage.

53
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,010
How do you make use of
Font Awesome in your web project?

54
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,150
You need to download the Font Awesome
distribution files, and then you

55
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:29,430
should include the CSS files that are part
of Font Awesome, into your web project.

56
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,950
And the fonts will automatically be used.

57
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,970
Now one way that I use
Font Awesome in my web projects

58
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,620
is after they download
the Font Awesome distribution files,

59
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,180
then I will copy the CSS files from
the CSS folder of the Font Awesome

60
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,290
folder into the CSS
folder of my web project.

61
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,570
And also I will copy the fonts
from the Font Awesome folder into

62
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,470
the fonts folder of my web project.

63
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,850
That's how I have been using.

64
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,795
You can include these Font Awesome files
in any other way that you choose to.

65
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:14,910
Another CSS class that I am going
to make use of in the exercise

66
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,566
that follows this lecture
is Bootstrap-social.

67
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:24,450
Bootstrap-social is a CSS
class that is available to

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,500
style some buttons for social web sites.

69
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,410
Bootstrap-social makes use of
Font Awesome's icon fonts that

70
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:43,158
are representing the logos for
the various social websites.

71
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:50,650
Now, Bootstrap-social adds additional
features to those Font Awesome icons.

72
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,113
So for example,
it takes the Font Awesome icon and

73
00:05:56,113 --> 00:06:03,030
then turns it into a button for
the various social media sites.

74
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,145
How do you make use of Bootstrap-social?

75
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:11,120
You download Bootstrap-social.CSS file and
then include it into your webpage.

76
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,070
Then wherever you need to
include a button to a social

77
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:24,440
website then you will include a A tag and
give it a class as button.

78
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,590
Button, of course, buttons which we
will examine in the next module.

79
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,450
Then you specify buttons social icon,

80
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,840
and button for
the specific social website.

81
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,680
So, in this example, you will see me
referring to button Facebook, and

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,430
then In addition, you would be including

83
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,340
the Font Awesome icon for
that particular social media site.

84
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:58,398
So that's why you see me using there
the i class, fa, and the fa-facebook

85
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:04,150
to use the Facebook icon that is included
as part of the Font Awesome set.

86
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,830
Now we will move on to our
next hands on exercise.

87
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:14,679
We will, in this exercise, go back to
the website what we have been designing so

88
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:19,570
far and then include the nav
bar into our web page.

89
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,640
In addition,
we'll make use of both Glyphicons and

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,890
then Font Awesome icons in various
locations on our web page.

91
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,310
We'll also use Bootstrap-social
to include some social

92
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,310
website buttons in
the footer of our webpage.
