1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,180
In the final exercise for
this module, we're gonna start with

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,700
the webpage that we completed at
the end of the previous exercise.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,480
And add a few more features first.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,901
We will build in a navigation
structure for our website.

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:25,365
We will do that by including a navigation
bar into our webpage and then

6
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:32,970
add in the links to other webpages that
are going to form part of our website.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,570
Now the remaining pages will be
added as we go through other modules

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,120
of this course.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,890
We will put the navigation structure
into place at this moment.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,848
The second item that we are going to
look at in this exercise is the use of

11
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:56,320
Icon font in designing our web pages.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,250
In particular,
we'll look at Font Awesome and

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,500
the built in glyphicons that
come with Bootstrap and

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,230
also we'll look at adding Bootstrap
social buttons, in order to create

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,310
buttons to various social
websites on our webpage.

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,990
As I mentioned in the body of a ratio
replace just before the header I'm

17
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,711
going to paste the code
to create the navbar.

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,990
So as you can see I have already pasted
the code for the navbar I am using the nav

19
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,156
element from HTML5 And
I have styled it with the navbar,

20
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:47,130
navbar-inverse and
navbar-static-top classes.

21
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,950
What this means is that this navbar
will appear at the top of the page.

22
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,440
Taking a look at the web page,
you can see that the navbar is displayed

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,190
at the top of the page and
will scroll as I scroll the page.

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,639
In addition,
you notice that that Home link

25
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:15,350
on the navbar is highlighted
with a darker background.

26
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,350
Now, I am using the active class
in order to highlight the.

27
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:27,820
Going back to our navbar code, you notice
that inside my navbar I have a container.

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,550
And within the container I
am using a unsorted list.

29
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,730
And I am styling it with
the class nav navbar-nav.

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:46,100
So this is where the links that
appear on our navbar are included.

31
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,890
The home link, in particular,
I have styled using the active class.

32
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,130
And hence,
it has been highlighted on the screen.

33
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,970
Going back to our web page,
let's see how the navbar behaves as we

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,810
resize that browser window.

35
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,620
So you can see that the navbar continues
to be displayed at the top, but

36
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,780
when we hit the extra small screen size,

37
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,030
do you notice that the navbar is
now being displayed vertically?

38
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,090
Now this is obviously going to
look look ugly on small screens.

39
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,110
How do we turn this navbar
into a responsive navbar?

40
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,240
Meaning that when you are displaying
it on extra small screens,

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,580
I want this content of
the navbar to be hidden and

42
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,120
only shown when I explicitly ask for
it to be shown.

43
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,380
Returning to our navbar,

44
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,300
I have pasted in additional code
in order to make it responsive.

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,440
We have seen this code already
in the lecture earlier.

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,510
So this code is exactly similar
to what I have shown you

47
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,220
earlier when we discussed
about bootstraps navbar.

48
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,760
So this makes the navbar responsive.

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
So after this change, let's go and
have a look at our web page and

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,790
see how it responds when
the browser window is shut.

51
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,230
Returning to the web page, we can now
see that the navbar has the additional

52
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,960
brand shown within the navbar.

53
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,320
In addition, as I shrink the webpage,
you notice that

54
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:38,175
when the page reaches the extra
small size, the links

55
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:44,735
in the navbar are now hidden, and instead,
to be replaced by this button here.

56
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:49,990
When I click on the button,
the items in the navbar are displayed,

57
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,430
so I can click and
hide by toggling, using this button.

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,940
As a next step, I'm going to introduce
a drop down into the navbar.

59
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm going to take the Menu
link in the navbar,

60
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,100
and then when I click on the Menu link,
it'll display a list of

61
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,500
items or
categories of items in the menu, so

62
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,850
that their visitor can be directly
taken to any one of those categories,

63
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,770
like appetizers, main courses,
desserts, and so on.

64
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,830
So, let's go ahead and
make the change the code,

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,090
and then review it, to introduce
the drop-down Into our navbar.

66
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,400
I have replaced the menu link
that we had in the unsorted list

67
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,670
by this list item,
whose class is dropdown.

68
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:52,740
So inside this list item, we have the
contents of the dropdown enclosed here.

69
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,860
Again inside another
unsorted list which is.

70
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,780
Styled with the class dropdown-menu.

71
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,690
So, this list will be displayed
when I click on the menu item.

72
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,690
Let's go visit the web page one more time.

73
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,420
Taking a look at the web page now,
you'll see that the Menu

74
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,750
item has now been replaced
with a Menu drop-down.

75
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,990
You'll see the small inverted
triangle there, indicating the caret.

76
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,980
Now, when I click on the item,

77
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,440
you can see the items on
the drop-down being displayed here.

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,230
The next modification that
I'm going to introduce is

79
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,520
to turn the navbar from a navbar
static top to a navbar fixed top.

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,785
So I'm gonna go in and
change the class from navbar-static-top

81
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:44,718
to navbar-fixed-top in
the navigation code.

82
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:48,718
Now in addition I'm going to paste in some

83
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:53,530
additional CSS classes
into mystyle.css file.

84
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,629
So let me paste that and
then we'll review it quickly.

85
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,580
The additional code that I
pasted into the mystyle.css

86
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,970
file allows me to style
the navbar in a bit more detail.

87
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,670
In particular, I am giving the body
a padding of 50 pixels, because now,

88
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:20,170
since the navbar is fixed at the top
of the page, the navbar is going to

89
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:25,686
cover the top 50 pixels
of the browser window.

90
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:30,388
If our body of our page scrolls,
then the top 50

91
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:35,340
pixels are gonna be hidden
underneath the navbar.

92
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,730
So, to avoid that,
I'm giving a upper margin of 50 pixels,

93
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:46,050
so that the body is
displayed below the navbar.

94
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,750
And will still be able to scroll without
getting hidden by the navbar on top.

95
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,110
I have also customized
the navbar color itself.

96
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,060
I have redefined navbar-inverse
to have a background color.

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,170
This reaches a darker shade of indigo.

98
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,547
In, addition I have customized
a few more of the navbar classes.

99
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:17,342
So I have made sure that,

100
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:23,596
The navbar,
if I am using the active class,

101
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:30,250
that background color is going to
be even darker shade of indigo.

102
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,970
And also, the color for
the text is going to be white.

103
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,420
So, with this change,
whenever I declare any one of the list

104
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,430
items in the navbar to be a active link,

105
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,400
then that will be colored even
darker than the navbar's color.

106
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,620
In addition, also for
the drop down menu, you saw that

107
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,620
drop down was being displayed with
Pale background with darker lettering.

108
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:10,180
I have changed that to follow
the same color as the navbar itself.

109
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,128
So after these changes, let's go and
take a quick look at the.

110
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:16,006
Now, going to the web page,

111
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:20,400
you can now notice that my navbar
has acquired a dark indigo color.

112
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,475
This is to contrast this with
the lighter indigo colors after.

113
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,690
In addition you see that the active
link is even more darker than

114
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,700
the dark indigo that I am using for
the navbar.

115
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,760
So that the highlighted link
is more clearly visible.

116
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,366
The Menu items,
when I click on that you see that

117
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:48,874
the background color of the drop
down has been changed, and

118
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:53,130
the items themselves are now
displayed in light color.

119
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:00,364
And as I scroll through the items,
the selected item is clearly identified.

120
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:07,055
Now, when you scroll this, Web page,

121
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:10,200
you notice that the scrolling,

122
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,940
none of the part of the web page
is hidden under the navbar.

123
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,640
Our last modification to the webpage

124
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,780
is going to introduce Icon
fonts into our webpage.

125
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:28,045
I'm going to make use of the built-in
glyphicons that come with Bootstrap.

126
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:33,355
In addition, I'll download
the Font Awesome Icon font by and

127
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:36,890
then include that into our web project.

128
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,800
Also, I will use Bootstrap Social to style

129
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,750
the social media buttons that
I have included in my webpage.

130
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,880
So, I had links in the footer
of the web page earlier so

131
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,030
I'm gonna turn those
links into buttons styled

132
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,690
with Font Awesome and Bootstrap Associate.

133
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,320
So let's go ahead and do that next.

134
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,890
First, we'll go to
the Font Awesome website.

135
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,420
And then download the Font Awesome code.

136
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,779
After you're done with the Font Awesome
zip file, move that to our project

137
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:29,612
directory, unzip it, and you will be
left with a font-awesome-4.4.3 folder.

138
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:35,452
Go into that folder and
then you will see a folder called CSS.

139
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:41,805
From the CSS folder,
take the two Font Awesome CSS finds and

140
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:46,900
then move them to the CSS
folder of our project.

141
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,700
Also in the Font Awesome folder,
you will find a folder named fonts.

142
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,310
Going to that fonts folder and

143
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,660
then move all the files from there
to our web projects fonts folder.

144
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,730
Once we are done with that,
we can now delete the font-awesome folder.

145
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,969
We no longer need the remaining
items from that folder.

146
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:20,070
Next, download bootstrapsocial.css
that we have provided for you.

147
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,140
This is a modified version of
bootstrapsocial.css file that is available

148
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,740
on the Internet.

149
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,638
We have modified it slightly to
introduce additional buttons for

150
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:33,721
Google+ and YouTube.

151
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,170
Okay, now we have assembled everything but
the need to use fonts in our webpage.

152
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,850
We are now gonna go to
the webpage HTML code, and

153
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,450
then add in the icons
into our webpage first.

154
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:57,581
We need to include the two CSS files,
the font-awesome.min.css, and

155
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:03,900
bootstrap-social.css files
into our HTML page.

156
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,360
So, let's go ahead and do that first,
in the head of the page.

157
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:17,930
The first icon that I'm going to introduce
is into the home link on our navbar.

158
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,990
So I'm going to introduce a home right
next to the home link of our navbar.

159
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,960
To do that, I'm going to make use of
the glyphicons for the home button.

160
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,190
So let me replace the home link list item

161
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,510
in the navbar and
then we'll have a quick look at the cut.

162
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,460
Taking a quick look at the modification,

163
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,800
I see that I am still defining
that link as an active link.

164
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,390
In addition to the home link that I have,
I have included this span

165
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,960
with a class called
glyphicon glyphicon-home.

166
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,370
That is how we make use of
glyphicons in our web page.

167
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,730
Next we go to the footer of our page.

168
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,950
And where we have the address, I'm going
to replace the telephone, the fax,

169
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:21,523
and the email links there
using fontasm icons.

170
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:29,028
Returning to the base code you see that
I have now replaced the telephone,

171
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:33,870
the fax, and
email letters from that address by

172
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,360
their corresponding photos and icons.

173
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,380
So, to use photos and icons,
we introduce Aa tag called i,

174
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,360
with a class fa fa-phone,
to reuse the phone icon.

175
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,590
And fax and envelope for the image icons.

176
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,070
So, with these changes I have introduced

177
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,550
four types of icons into
the address in the footer.

178
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:10,500
Our last change is to the social
media links that are in the footer.

179
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,610
I'm gonna replace those
text links with buttons,

180
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,820
using Bootstrap Socials
tiled Font Awesome icons for

181
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,970
the different social media sites.

182
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,060
So let me substitute
the code in place there and

183
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,780
then we'll have a look at the source code.

184
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,770
Returning to the source code, you can
now see that I have replaced those links

185
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,350
with Bootstrap Social paste buttons.

186
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,470
How do we do that?

187
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,750
Let's go and have a look at the code.

188
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:51,540
Now the div that I have there, I have
turned the div into a navbar-nav class.

189
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,580
So, we can use navbar stylings in

190
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,110
other locations in our webpage,
if we wish to.

191
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,135
So I'm using that to define this bar

192
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:11,020
containing the icons of
all my social media links.

193
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,470
So, for each one of those links,

194
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,300
let's have a look at the link
corresponding to Google+ here.

195
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,040
So I am defining a tag a,
with the class button.

196
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,040
So I am turning that into
your button class, and

197
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,060
then I am saying button social icon,
and button Google+.

198
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:38,920
So this description comes from Bootstrap
Social's way of specifying buttons.

199
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,009
And then inside there I am
using the Font Awesome icon for

200
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,188
Google+ enclosed in there.

201
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:50,553
Now the button is styled to be
like the Google+'s standard

202
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:56,360
buttons that you would see
on many different web pages.

203
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:05,140
Similarly for the remaining social
links within that part of the footer.

204
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,170
So after these changes let's go and
have a look at our web page.

205
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,790
Returning to our web page.

206
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,960
Now in the navbar,
you see that next to the Home link

207
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:23,180
we have an icon which is the glyphicon
that we have included there.

208
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,980
Now, moving to the footer, we can see that

209
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,630
the telephone, fax, and
email are now replaced by icons.

210
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,610
Also, have a look at
the links to the social

211
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,820
media sites that we
have on the right side.

212
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,776
They have all now been
turned into buttons.

213
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:55,080
This completes this exercise.

214
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,360
In this exercise we looked
at using navbars and

215
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,310
using a responsive navbar in our webpage.

216
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,689
In addition,
we looked at using icon fonts and

217
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:15,205
introduced additional CSS
classes to style our webpage.
