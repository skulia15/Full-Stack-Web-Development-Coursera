1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,220
Let's talk about your first assignment.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,851
In this assignment, we will give you
a preformatted aboutus.html page.

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:14,594
You're going to add this page to
the website that you have been working

4
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:15,920
on so far.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,340
You will configure all
the links appropriately so

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,160
that the page gets integrated
into your website.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,610
In addition, you're going to format
the information within this website.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,300
Also, you will learn how
to add breadcrumbs to

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,000
the web page, the aboutus.html
page that we provide for you.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,080
To get you started, we will give you
an aboutus.html page that looks like this.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,864
As you can see,

12
00:00:53,864 --> 00:01:00,100
the aboutus.html page is already
preformatted with some information.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,841
At the end of this assignment,
you're going to take this web page and

14
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:06,740
turn it into this web page.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,528
The first task in this
assignment is to set

16
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:24,550
up the links in the navbar appropriately.

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:30,950
So, you see that we are identifying the
about page correctly in the navbar, and

18
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,990
in addition, when I click on either
the name of the restaurant or

19
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,250
the brand, or the Home button, I should
be able to return to my index.html page.

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,220
So clicking on any one of them will
take me back to the index.html page

21
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,460
that you have already
developed in the exercises.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,400
The second part of the task one is to
add the glyph icon to the About page.

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,589
The second task involves configuring
the breadcrumbs for the aboutus.html page.

24
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:08,229
We are going to make use
of Bootstrap support for

25
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,870
breadcrumbs to design this part.

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,520
In this breadcrumbs, the hierarchy of
the page should be properly identified.

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,940
In addition,
the Home link should be activated so

28
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,990
that when I click on it I will be
able to go back to the Home page.

29
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,460
The final task of this
assignment is to complete

30
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,120
the formatting of the contents
of this web page.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,905
So we should be using the container row,
and column classes appropriately, so

32
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:47,335
that the entire content of this web
page is enclosed inside a container,

33
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,965
including the bread crumbs.

34
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:53,185
And appropriate rule classes
are applied to the content,

35
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:56,735
and column classes
are applied to the content.

36
00:02:56,735 --> 00:03:02,915
So that the page now will look like this
at the completion of this assignment.
