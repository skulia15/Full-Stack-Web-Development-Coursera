1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,220
Let us now look at another

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,030
interesting JavaScript component
in Bootstrap called the carousel.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,200
The carousel allows you to present
a slideshow on your webpage.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,080
Let's take a look at an example and

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,550
then we'll come back and
consider the carousel in more detail.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,301
Going to our webpage,

7
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:28,490
you can see that I have already included
the carousel component on the webpage.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,000
So you can see that the carousel
presents a set of slides that will keep

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,700
sliding from left to right on the webpage.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,830
So this is an interesting way of
presenting content to the users.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,010
So a carousel is an interesting
component that allows us to present

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,310
a slideshow on the webpage,
as you saw from the example.

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,990
So the slides will keep sliding from
left to right with a time duration,

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,130
typically around three
seconds between slides.

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,760
The carousel also provides
manual control so

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,379
that the users can navigate to any
of the slides within the carousel.

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,450
We will look at all these
in more detail next.

18
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:19,930
To add a carousel to your webpage, you
will add a div with the classes carousel

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,740
and slide and also the data attribute,
data-ride, carousel.

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,671
This is what turns this into a carousel
control by the JavaScript plugin.

21
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:36,558
To add slides to the carousel, we will,

22
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:40,961
inside the div that we have already
introduced for the carousel,

23
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:45,459
we will introduce another div
with the class as carousel-inner.

24
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,240
And inside this div,

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,100
individual slides will be identified
by an inner div class item.

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,830
One of those inner divs will be identified
as an active, meaning that when you

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,900
first go to the webpage, that particular
slide will be presented to that user.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,870
So that is the first slide in the slide
deck being presented to the user.

29
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:16,810
Now, each item can include
an image together with a caption.

30
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,719
So inside the item div,

31
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,878
you would include another div
with the class carousel caption.

32
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,171
So inside this inner div with carousel
caption, you can include any HTML code.

33
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:34,850
Typically, we would have a heading and
some text included there.

34
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,870
Now, to introduce manual
controls to the carousel,

35
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,580
we can have two different
kinds of controls.

36
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,000
One control allows you to
select the specific slide.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,090
Now, this is introduced to the carousel
in the form of darts at the bottom,

38
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,230
as you can see in the image there.

39
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,240
You can select any one of those slides
by clicking one of the unfilled darts.

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,450
If you click on those unfilled darts, you
will move to that particular slides there.

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,700
The indicated controls are introduced
into the carousel by including an ol

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,510
with the class carousel controls, and
the list items in there will contain

43
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,940
two data attributes, the data target,
which is the mycarousel,

44
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,395
and then the data-slide-to,
which will give the number of

45
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:32,440
the slide to which you should move when
you click on that particular item.

46
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,730
Carousel's also introduced left and
right indicators to the carousel.

47
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,370
So the left and
right indicators can be shown as left and

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,490
right arrow buttons on the two ends.

49
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,100
In this case, we are introducing them
using the a tags with the classes

50
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,303
left carousel-control and
right carousel-control.

51
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,542
These classes can include inside
a glyphicon, so in this case

52
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:08,260
I am using the left chevron and the right
chevron as the glyphicon inside, so that

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,030
these controls can be shown on the screen
as the left and right buttons there.

54
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,000
Clicking on these will manually
take you to the previous and

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,240
the next slide in the carousel slide deck.

56
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,754
Now we will move on to the next exercise.

57
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:33,380
There we will introduce a carousel into
our webpage in the index storage TML page.

58
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,904
Now, we will also introduce manual
controls to this carousel so

59
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:43,450
we learn how to introduce manual controls
and make use of them on our carousel.
