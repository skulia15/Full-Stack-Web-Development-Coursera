1
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:06,250
The carousel is a very
interesting Bootstrap complement.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,610
It presents a list of scrolling
images on the screen.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,660
So as the images scroll
one by one on the screen,

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,280
it adds a lot of dynamism to your website.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,230
Now of course, sometimes you might find it
to be too distracting, but let's anyway

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,470
explore the carousel components to
understand how we can configure it.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:36,300
Of course, as you realize the carousel
component is a JavaScript-based component,

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,850
and so would require JavaScript
support for it to work correctly.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,660
We're gonna go to the index route HTML
page and add a carousel component.

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:55,128
At the top of the page, right after the
restaurant's title, below the Jumbotron.

11
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:01,916
Taking a look at
the index.html page I want to

12
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:07,165
introduce the carousel right
after the jumbotron vec.

13
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:11,015
I'm going to take the content
from the remaining three columns,

14
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:18,080
the content columns of this page and
then move it into the carousel.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,500
Or rather I will just copy
it into the carousel.

16
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:30,430
The carousel will be in its own row at
the top of the content part of the page.

17
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,340
After I design the carousel,
we'll look at the entire web page, and

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,980
then you can decide whether you like
the carousel better or to present

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,910
the information in the form of consecutive
rows as we are doing at this moment.

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,360
But in any case,
the carousel is an interesting component.

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,628
So let's explore that to
understand how it works.

22
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:56,282
Going to the HTML code I'm
going to introduce another row,

23
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,819
a content row,
inside the container here and

24
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,770
inside this content row I'm
going to introduce the carousel.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,400
So as you can see I have already
added the content row and

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,590
set up a div inside to expand
the entire 12 columns.

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,700
Now, inside this inner div,
I'm going to introduce the carousel.

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,190
Let me introduce the basic code for
the carousel, and

29
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,110
then we will look at
the code in more detail.

30
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,950
To set up a carousel,
I need to introduce a div with

31
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,520
a class carousel and
a class slide attached to this div.

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,213
I'm going to give, this div and
Id as my carousel, and

33
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:51,712
then also a data attribute
as data-ride carousel.

34
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:58,285
Inside this div,
I have introduced another div with

35
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:03,440
the class carousel-inner and
with the role list box.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,200
This carousel-inner contains
all the information

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,158
that will be displayed on the carousel.

38
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:14,470
Inside this div,

39
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,350
we will introduce each item within
the carousel as a div with the class item.

40
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,250
One of these divs will be
designated as active, so

41
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,950
that is the one that
the carousel will begin with.

42
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,450
Inside the item class,
I can include an image.

43
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,400
So what I have done here is to take the
image that we already have for the dish

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,710
that we introduced earlier, and then I
just pasted that image information here.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,680
Together with the image, I can also
have a caption being displayed for

46
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,120
that carousel slide there.

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,695
So, that is what I am supporting using
the div inside there with the class

48
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,450
carousel-caption.

49
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,850
Now, inside the div carousel-caption
I can include HTML code.

50
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,364
So, what I have done is to take
the information from my first row,

51
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:13,295
and then cut and
paste it inside this div here.

52
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:20,370
Now, the same thing I'm going to do for
two more items in the carousel.

53
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,610
So, the second item corresponds to
the second row of our existing HTML page,

54
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,400
the image and the information from there.

55
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,180
And the third item corresponds
to the third image from,

56
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,130
rather, the third row from
our existing web page.

57
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,722
After introducing these three items,

58
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:50,499
we need to go and
fix a few things in our CSS file so

59
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:56,129
that the carousel is properly
displayed on the screen.

60
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:03,175
Moving to the mystyles.css file,

61
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:08,300
I have introduced a few
additional CSS classes there.

62
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,150
Let's take a quick look at them, and

63
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,800
then understand what these
CSS classes are setting up.

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,340
The first CSS class is of course carousel,
for

65
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,410
which I am setting up the background
as a dark indigo color.

66
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,670
This is the same color that I'm using for
my nav bar, the highlighted

67
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,530
part of the nav bar, there,
just to match the color schemes.

68
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,150
So, I'm using the same color for
the colors of background.

69
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,050
Now that inside the carousel's
individual items I have set up

70
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,220
their height to be 300 pixels.

71
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,650
So my carousel's height will now be fixed.

72
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,160
And the item's image that I include
in the carousel, I am specifying

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,970
its position as absolute, with the top
left corners being set to 0, 0.

74
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,410
So, this image that I include there
will be stuck on the left edge of this

75
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:09,030
carousel slide, with the top and
left at point 0, 0.

76
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,970
So the top corner and the left corner of
the image aligned with the top zero and

77
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,100
left zero corner of the slide.

78
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,970
And I have specified the image's
minimum height to be 300 pixels.

79
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,300
So no matter what kind of
a range I put in there,

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,060
the height will be appropriately
at least given to 300 pixels.

81
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,780
If you include a larger image then
obviously the cursor will stretch to

82
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,791
include the larger image Now,
with these changes, let's go and

83
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:46,320
take a look at the web page and understand
how the carousel behaves on our web page.

84
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,780
Returning to our web page,

85
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,680
you can now see the carousel in place
in the web page in its own room.

86
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,420
Now, I have put my mouse cursor on the
carousel, so the carousel is now stuck.

87
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,510
So, if I remove the mouse cursor from
the carousel it will start sliding left

88
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,190
after a certain delay.

89
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,000
The default delay here is three seconds.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,370
So every three seconds,
the slide will move to the left.

91
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,796
So this is the behavior of the carousel.

92
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:31,420
Now, I'm gonna introduce two
new controls in to the close.

93
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,950
The first control will show three dots

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,690
towards the bottom of the carousel, which
will help me to select whichever slide

95
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,440
item from the carousel that
is displayed on the screen.

96
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,750
The second control that I will
introduce is a left and a right button

97
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,810
on the left edge and the right edge of
the carousel, so that I can click them and

98
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,650
then manually make the carousel
go left and right.

99
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,590
So, first let me introduce
the carousel indicators here.

100
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,530
So, within the carousel I
am using an ol class here.

101
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,570
With the class set as carousel-indicators,

102
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,460
and then inside here, I have specified
three list items, each of these

103
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,240
with the data-target set to mycarousel,
which is the ID of the carousel.

104
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,940
And then also the second attribute
that I have here is data slide two and

105
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,280
then specifies which particular slide
I should go to zero, one, or two.

106
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,460
In this example we have three slides
that I have already introduced so

107
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,850
that's why we can have indicators there.

108
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,020
Show which slide I would be able to go to.

109
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,490
The next controls that I am
introducing into my carousel is that

110
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,190
two edges of the carousel,
two buttons on the left and

111
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,010
the right edge of the carousel,
which when clicked,

112
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,650
will allow me to change the slides
manually within the carousel.

113
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,535
So to implement that on
the left side I am introducing

114
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:16,955
an a tag acting as a button.

115
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:22,205
The width of the class is left and
carousel-control.

116
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:28,190
And then the href pointing to
the mycarousel, the ID of this carousel,

117
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,990
and the inside where I am using
a glyphicon the left chevron for

118
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,380
this and the other one is
the right carousel control.

119
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:41,355
And also using the right
chevron glyphicon.

120
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,899
Now with these changes, let's go and

121
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,805
have a look at our web page to
understand how it looks like.

122
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:51,487
Going to your webpage,

123
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:56,187
you can now see that at the bottom
you have now three dots here.

124
00:09:56,187 --> 00:10:02,893
One of them filled dot and
the remaining two are unfilled dots.

125
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,803
These allow me to select
which slide I want to view.

126
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:09,293
So, for example, if I want to go to the
third slide, I can just click on that, and

127
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:13,943
then it'll show me the third slide,
or the second slide, and so on.

128
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:17,639
So these indicators allow
me to navigate through

129
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,891
the slides inside the carousel manually.

130
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:26,351
Also, you can see that on the left
edge and the right edge, you have

131
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:31,850
the chevrons displayed here, so these
are the left and right controls patterns,

132
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,120
so I can click on this to go to
the next slide on the right side.

133
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,990
Similarly, I can click on this to go
to the previous slide on the left side.

134
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,070
So this manually allows you to page

135
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,830
through the various slides
with your carousel.

136
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,920
But this is an interesting component,

137
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,140
and has a little more
dynamism to your picture.
