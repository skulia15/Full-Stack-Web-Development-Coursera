1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,706
In our next exercise,
we're going to examine tool tips and

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:10,410
modals and
how we can add these to our page.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,310
We're gonna go to the index.html
page that we have been designing so

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,210
far on our website.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,090
And we're going to add a tooltip and we're
also going to add a modal to this webpage.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,884
You will also explore modals in
more detail in the assignment that

7
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:32,421
follows at the end of this module.

8
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,837
Going to our webpage.

9
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:44,590
We see that in the index.html file,
we have this button here.

10
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,500
I would like to introduce a tooltip for
the button so

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,300
that when you hover on that button,
then a tooltip will pop up.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,410
In addition, we have a form in the navbar
which was used for signing in.

13
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,820
I'm gooing to shift
that form into a modal.

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,825
So that you only have a login button
there and when you click on that login,

15
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:14,266
then that modal will pop up and
allow you to enter your username and

16
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,045
password and then login to the website.

17
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:24,436
To introduce a tooltip into
a website in the index.html file,

18
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:31,380
they will navigate down to the jumbotron
which contains that button.

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,200
For the button I'm going to
introduce a tooltip into the a tag

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,510
which represents that button.

21
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,660
Let me introduce the code and
then we'll come back and

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,060
examine that code in a little more detail
and then see the result on the web page.

23
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,160
Here you see that I
have already introduced

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,990
the tooltip to the a tag in the jumbotron.

25
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:02,010
So to introduce a tooltip I have
introduced a data-toggle, the tooltip,

26
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,200
and also, given in the title attribute,

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,925
I have given the information that should
be displayed in the tooltip there.

28
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:15,500
To activate tooltip,
you remember that we have to

29
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,400
add appropriate JavaScript
code to the page.

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,837
So let's go to the bottom of the webpage
and then add the correct JavaScript code.

31
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,009
I have now added the code,
the JavaScript code,

32
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,220
in order to activate the tooltip here.

33
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,500
So in this JavaScript code you see
that when the document is ready.

34
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,277
And for this data-toggle="tooltip",

35
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:49,666
wherever you have this
included as an attribute for

36
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,452
the element and will activate the tooltip.

37
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,990
So after making these changes, let's save
the changes and then we'll go back and

38
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,380
look at the web page.

39
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,840
Coming to the web page,
you now see that when you put your cursor

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,320
on the button,
the tooltip pops up at the bottom here.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:22,088
Showing the message that we included in
the title attribute of the button there.

42
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,062
The button still works
as a regular button, so

43
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:31,520
when you click on it you can still go
to the form at the bottom of the page.

44
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:39,087
But the tooltip also is displayed when
you just hover over that button there.

45
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:46,128
Our next step is to introduce the modal,
so

46
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:50,390
that we can shift the login
form into their modal.

47
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,190
So to do that I go right up to the top and

48
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,130
right after the nav element there,
the navbar there.

49
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:03,250
I introduce the code for the modal
as specified on the workshop site,

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,560
normally when you are using modals it is
always better to include the modal code

51
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,668
at the top of the page.

52
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:14,030
So that subsequent changes in the web page

53
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,430
will not affect the modal
behavior in any way.

54
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,910
So let me introduce the code for the modal
there, and then we'll come back and

55
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,740
examine what we have done.

56
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,370
Now, I have introduced the code for
setting up the modal into place there.

57
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,290
So you can see that I have an outer div,
which I have given an id as the loginModal

58
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,230
and the corresponding class as
modal with the fade class also.

59
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,962
Meaning that when the modal
is dismissed it will fade.

60
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:53,212
And when the modal is invoked,
it will fade in.

61
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:58,640
And inside the modal I have the class
called as the model-dialog class.

62
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,700
And then inside the modal-dialog
class I have the modal-content here.

63
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,410
So in the modal-content we will have
the modal-header, body and also footer.

64
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,170
For this particular modal
I am not using a footer so

65
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,386
I only have the modal-header and the body.

66
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:20,554
In the modal-header I am introducing

67
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:25,750
a button for the closing of the modal.

68
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,020
So you have a cross button there, so
we have seen such button being introduced

69
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,420
even for the alert class earlier, so
the same kind we are using here and

70
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,240
then the modal-title is introduced there.

71
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,270
So that completes the modal-header.

72
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,820
Now the modal-body will contain
the actual body of this modal.

73
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,070
Now currently it is empty.

74
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,910
Now remember that I had
a navbar form that I

75
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,990
used earlier to enable the users to
type in their login information.

76
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,265
So I'm going to go into the navbar and
then cut out that form and

77
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:09,880
then paste it into this location and
then edit that form a little bit.

78
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,930
So to do that let's scroll
back to that navbar there,

79
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,330
and then we have the form element there,
so

80
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,140
I am just going to cut the entire
form element from there and

81
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:31,110
then paste it into the modal there.

82
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,180
So cutting out that element from there.

83
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,920
We no longer need it there.

84
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,337
So I'm going to take that and
then paste it into the modal body here.

85
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:50,275
The form can be retained as such because
that is exactly what we want the form to

86
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:50,970
perform.

87
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,653
But now the form is no
longer a navbar form, so

88
00:06:55,653 --> 00:07:00,459
I need to change the class to form-inline,
so

89
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:07,504
that their elements are displayed
in line inside that modal there.

90
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,453
In addition, in the form right
after the sign in button,

91
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:18,200
I will also introduce
a cancel button there.

92
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,660
So if the user doesn't want to log in
they can press the cancel button and

93
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,970
then dismiss the form.

94
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,060
So, let me introduce the code and

95
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,129
then we'll have a quick
look at that code there.

96
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:40,655
You can now see that I have introduced
an additional button there of the class

97
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:43,110
button type and button default.

98
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,161
And the corresponding attribute there
also says data-dismiss="modal",

99
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:54,500
meaning that when this button is
clicked the modal will be dismissed.

100
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,360
After making these changes we now
need a way of invoking the modal.

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,690
So we have to introduce
another link into our

102
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,798
navbar, which when clicked
will invoke the modal.

103
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:17,240
So to do that I go back to the navbar
there and right after the ul data,

104
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,090
I will introduce another
nav element there.

105
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:28,430
Which will contain a list item which
when clicked will invoke the modal.

106
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,260
I have now introduced another nav element.

107
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:38,430
So here you see that I am using the ul
tag with the class nav, navbar, nav.

108
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,740
But in addition, I am saying using
the class navbar-right, meaning

109
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,280
that whatever content in this ul will be
pushed to the right side of the navbar.

110
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,130
So inside this navbar
I have one list item.

111
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,830
This list item is the one
that is going to be used

112
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,470
to invoke the modal.

113
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,710
So in here I am using the a tag
with a data-toggle modal and

114
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,440
the data-target as loginModal.

115
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,209
Remember that I have used loginModal as
the ID for the modal that I introduced

116
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:20,430
earlier, so this is the same thing
specified as the data target here.

117
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,550
Now inside here of course
I have the login and

118
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,800
then a glyphicon that I use
to indicate the login there.

119
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,580
So with these changes,
let's save the file, and

120
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,462
then go back and
look at the changes on our webpage.

121
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:41,511
Coming back to our webpage,
in the index.html file,

122
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:47,650
we saw that the tooltip already works when
we hover onto the Reserve Table button.

123
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:53,061
Now, you also see that there is
a Login in the navbar there,

124
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:56,211
so let's click on the login link.

125
00:09:56,211 --> 00:10:00,646
And when you click on the Login
link you now see that

126
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:05,087
the modal is shown here at
the top of the page here.

127
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:09,358
So inside this modal is you can see that
the login information can be typed in and

128
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,180
then you have the Sign In button.

129
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,280
If you click on the Cancel button
of course the Login is dismissed.

130
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,520
Similarly if you click on this cross,
also the Login is dismissed.

131
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,350
And again, walking the modal if you type
in the email and password and click on

132
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,480
the Sign In button, then the sign in
operation should be invoked at that point.

133
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,387
Currently of course,
the form is not active

134
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:41,028
because we don't have a server in place to

135
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:46,212
validate the user's
identity at the moment.

136
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:54,535
This completes this exercise where
we explored tool tips and modals.
