1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,480
In the third assignment we're going to
continue to further modify the index or

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,730
html file.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,300
There are four tasks in this assignment,
and

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,610
let me illustrate those four tasks
to you by showing you the locations

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,307
of those four tasks in
the updated index.html page.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,740
Going to your index.html page,
the first task is to

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,130
remove the tool tab from
this button here so when you

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,020
put your mouse cursor on the button
it will no longer show the tool tab.

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,610
Now, in bootstrap on a single element you
cannot have multiple data attributes.

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,320
So which means that multiple
JavaScript competence can't be invoked

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,630
from a single element.

12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,830
So that's why we have to remove the tool
tab because I'm gonna be making use of

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,980
this button to invoke a model later on

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,910
to show the reservation form for
the table.

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,720
The second task is to
shift the reservation

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,295
form and the alert message
that was there in the fourth

17
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:24,140
content row on this page into a model.

18
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,670
So as you can see,
this model now contains the table

19
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,460
reservation form here, and also the alert
message has been moved into this model.

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,894
Now, to invoke this model,
we are going to use

21
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:47,950
the reserve table button that we have
already included in the Jumbotron.

22
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,580
That is the third task for you.

23
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,170
So, the third task is to setup
the reserve table button so

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,460
that when it is clicked the model
will be shown on the screen.

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,911
The last task of this assignment

26
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:09,830
is to include another row here.

27
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,480
In this row we will have
a button group with two

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,150
radio buttons here which
allows the user to

29
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,900
specify weather they want the non-smoking
or the smoking section of the restaurant.

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,040
So this is a radio button group.

31
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,170
By default,
the non-smoking button is selected.

32
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,790
You can allow the user to select one or
the other buttons,

33
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,950
so when one of the buttons is clicked,
the other one should be deselected.

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,102
The row should have
the label name section and

35
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:54,700
the Non-Smoking button
should have green color, and

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,210
the Smoking button should have red color.

37
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:04,090
Make use of Bootstrap's standard colors
for configuring these two buttons there.

38
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,183
So this completes the third assignment.
