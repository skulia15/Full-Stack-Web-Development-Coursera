1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,480
In the previous module we have
seen a number of bootstrapped

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,610
components that are supported
through the CSS classes.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,000
In this module we'll look at the Java
script supported bootstrap components.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,253
All these components that we
examine this module will require

5
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:25,515
a JavaScript plugin to be in place for
them to work correctly.

6
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:31,589
As we have seen in
the previous two modules,

7
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,838
Bootstrap provides a rich set of
CSS classes that can be applied to

8
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:42,760
many HTML elements in order to
create the Bootstrap components.

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,910
These components,
as we saw in the previous module,

10
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,520
are created by just applying
the Bootstrap's CSS classes.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,970
Now, you can use Bootstrap purely for
its CSS classes and

12
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,250
completely ignore
the JavaScript plugins and

13
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,680
the JavaScript based
components in Bootstrap.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,530
But let's also examine how we
can make use of the Java Script

15
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,120
based components in
Bootstrap in this module.

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,220
As we saw in the previous module,
CSS classes for

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,400
many components start with the base class,
like for example the button class.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,940
Or from class or
the table class and so on.

19
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,810
But these classes can be
further modified by applying

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,860
additional CSS classes that belong
to the same group of classes.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,670
As an example,
let's look at the button class.

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,430
We can create a simple button by
just applying the btn class, but

23
00:01:52,430 --> 00:02:00,515
we would want to further qualify it by
giving it one of the standard colors.

24
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:03,545
Perhaps even specify
the size of the class.

25
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:07,467
And also whether it should
be a block button or not.

26
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:13,627
So all these additional classes
that belong to the button

27
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:18,657
group of classes act as modifiers
to the button base class.

28
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:27,367
Similarly, we have seen the nav class
before, which was applied to URL and

29
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:32,320
for creating a component
within the nav bar.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,590
Be applied to the UL, the nav, and
then the navbar-nav class too.

31
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,180
In this module, we'll examine
the nav class again, but here,

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,370
we will apply the nav-tabs and
the nav-pills class to create

33
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,840
different kinds of navigational elements.

34
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,700
Now, let's talk about
Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins themselves.

35
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,680
Bootstrap's JavaScript support comes
through a set of JavaScript plugins.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,730
These plugins are built upon Jquery,
so Bootstrap's JavaScript

37
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,190
competence depend upon Jquery to
be present within your picture.

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,320
That is the reason why,
when we include in the Bootstraps,

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,180
JS competence,
we also include a Jquery under the pitch.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,170
The plugins themselves have designs
such that you can only include

41
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,870
those plugins that you really need.

42
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,455
If you want to include all the plugins,
that is also feasible.

43
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,471
This graphic may help you to better
understand the view of JavaScript,

44
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:46,930
JQuery, and Bootstrap's components.

45
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,690
If you look at JavaScript as
the big heavy Sumo wrestler.

46
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,950
Then JQuery is a condensed
version of the sumo wrestler,

47
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,610
more easier to handle, so
to speak, than the full JavaScript.

48
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,930
Because the JQuery library
plugins that come in,

49
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:12,390
are very very useful to achieve many
interesting aspects within your web page.

50
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,800
Now, what Bootstrap does is
goes one more step further, and

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,935
then builds upon JQuery plugins,
and then boxes them in.

52
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:25,575
Into tiny little components
which can be used on their own.

53
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:30,285
You will pretty soon realize that you can
use the Bootstrap's components without

54
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:34,045
writing a single line of JavaScript code.

55
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:38,535
That's the advantage that you get
with Bootstrap's JS components.

56
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:42,110
But again, it comes with less flexibility,

57
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,980
when you use it without
writing JavaScript code.

58
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,170
How do you include the Bootstrap's
JavaScript plugins in your page?

59
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,744
We've already seen that at the bottom
of the page we would include these two

60
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:05,090
statements to import that JQuery library,

61
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,650
as well as the Bootstraps complete
set of JavaScript plugins.

62
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,850
Now again, as I said, Bootstraps
JavaScript components can be used without

63
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,670
writing a single line of code.

64
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,740
Now this is feasible
because Bootstraps applies

65
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,608
what they call is a first class API.

66
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:28,726
With data-stash attributes, for

67
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:34,910
example the data-toggle,
the data-spy and so on.

68
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,770
Many attributes that
Bootstrap JS components define.

69
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,650
Now you can apply these attributes to

70
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,110
the HTML elements that you use
within your web page directly.

71
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,440
And without even writing
a single line of JavaScript code,

72
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,340
the JavaScript components
are ready to go for you.

73
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,350
Of course,
they won't have the flexibility that

74
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:06,580
you might get with directly writing
JQuery code to control this components.

75
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,480
But much of the functionality
is very much available

76
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,230
through the data star attributes.

77
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,550
This is the approach that we're
gonna explore in this module.

78
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:25,290
We look at them all full featured
JavaScript API in the next module.

79
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,290
In order for you to use the full
fledged JavaScript API you need to be

80
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:38,060
aware of the JQuery syntax and
have enough knowledge of JavaScript.
