1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,552
We will now talk about
the collapse plugin,

2
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:09,190
which is one of
the Bootstrap JavaScript components.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,050
We will see how we can make use of
the collapse plugin to show and

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,570
hide content on our web page.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,390
We will also examine how the collapse
plugin has been leveraged with

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,090
our nav bar, in order to collapse
the nav bar when you see that

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,070
page on extra small screens.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,790
And then reveal their nav bar
items upon clicking of a button.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,030
We'll then see how we can make use of the
collapse plugin together with the panel

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,740
class and the panel group classes
to construct an accordion.

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,550
The collapse plugin
provides a very quick and

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,920
easy way of showing and
hiding content on our web page.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,030
To toggle the show and hide behavior of
our content we need to make use of either

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,020
a button or a link, which,
when clicked, will toggle the content.

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,840
Now we'll look at a simple example
of the collapse plugin in use and

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,760
then review the code thereafter.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,820
Taking a look at this simple example,
you can see that we have some content

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,460
displayed on the left side here, and
then a button on the right side.

19
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,300
So when you click on the button,

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,080
the information will be either revealed or
hidden.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,730
Right now, we start out with
the information being shown on the page.

22
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,780
When you click on the button,
the information is hidden and

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,960
then when you click on the button again,
the information is shown.

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,700
So this toggling of behavior is
enabled by using the collapse plugin.

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,930
Let's now review the source code for
the collapse example that we just saw.

26
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,290
So in this case, this collapse
example is implemented by using a div

27
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,500
with a class collapse and
in applied to it.

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,950
So we have two classes there.

29
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,770
Collapse class and in class,
together being applied to this div.

30
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,530
So this is the div that
contains the content

31
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,250
that is going to be either shown or
hidden by clicking on the button.

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,020
So the next part is the button itself,

33
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:38,300
which is going to trigger this toggling
of the showing and hiding of the content.

34
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,450
So this toggle button is implemented
by using a standard a tag

35
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,180
with the button class as btn-primary,
as you see in the example there.

36
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,430
In addition, for the toggle to take place,

37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,990
we have a data attribute
called data-toggle.

38
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,460
And then the data-toggle
with the collapse attribute.

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,440
And the href of this a tag
will refer to the ID

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,680
of the div which contains
the content that should be shown and

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,520
hidden upon clicking of this button.

42
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,908
So, together with these,
this code implements the collapsing and

43
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:28,666
hiding of the content for
this simple example.

44
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:33,851
Returning to the navigation bar that
we have seen in the very first week,

45
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:38,951
you'll recall that on extra small screens,
we had a button on the right

46
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:44,280
side which when clicked would
either reveal or hide the content.

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,150
Now, this action was actually implemented
using the collapse plugin there.

48
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,390
At that point,

49
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,390
I mentioned that I would come back
to this in one of the later modules.

50
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,630
So now we will go back and reexamine
the code that implemented this collapse

51
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,915
behavior and then understand how we
are leveraging the collapse plugin

52
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:08,595
to enable this behavior.

53
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:13,155
Looking back at the source code that we
had seen earlier, you can now see that

54
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:18,827
the button has been implemented there,
with the data-toggle as collapse and

55
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:23,050
the data-target pointing to the navbar.

56
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,960
If you recall from the week one
module where we explained navigation,

57
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,610
I had pointed out these two items there.

58
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,150
Now, having known how the JavaScript
components operate in Bootstrap,

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,430
it all makes a lot more sense.

60
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,095
So with this data-toggle
that we implemented there,

61
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:44,340
data-toggle collapse and
the data-target is navbar.

62
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:51,190
Now the whole navigation element,
the ul was enclosed inside a div,

63
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,880
which was given the class
navbar-collapse and collapse.

64
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,890
So what happens is that when you view
this web page on an extra small screen,

65
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:09,360
by default the navigation bar containing
the navigation elements is collapsed.

66
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,760
Because this div has only been
given the collapse class there.

67
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,565
It has not been given the in
together with the collapse class.

68
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:23,239
If you give the in class
together with the collapse class

69
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,818
the div will start in
the shown mode there,

70
00:05:26,818 --> 00:05:32,830
which means that the content will
actually be shown on the screen.

71
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,665
So since we avoided
the use of the in class,

72
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:38,665
the content will start
in the collapsed border.

73
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:41,325
When the button is clicked,
the content will revealed.

74
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:44,375
And when the button is again clicked,
the content will be hidden.

75
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,752
So that is how the navigation
bar worked for

76
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:51,412
the collapse plugin that we used earlier.

77
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:57,842
So that is how the navigation
bar with the collapse plugin

78
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:01,432
together worked for
the extra small screens.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,880
Going to back to our about
our aboutus.html page.

80
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,420
Now I have replaced the entire
tabbed navigation that I had for

81
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,790
the corporate leadership information
earlier, using an accordion.

82
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,650
The accordion works by using a panel group

83
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,270
together with a set of panels
that enclose the content.

84
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:33,700
We have already seen the panel component
in Bootstrap in the previous module.

85
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,060
So let's see the accordion in action.

86
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,440
So, when you look at the web page, you
will see that the web page starts out with

87
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,750
that first panel containing
the details of the CEO being shown,

88
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,050
and the remaining panels being hidden.

89
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,100
Now, if you click on any one of the other
panels, then the result is that

90
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,530
that particular panel gets revealed,
and the remaining panels get hidden.

91
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,030
So you can see the behavior
with the remaining panels too.

92
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,750
So you can click on any one
of those panels heading and

93
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,275
then the contents of
the panel will be revealed,

94
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:15,410
while the contents of the remaining
panels will be hidden.

95
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,720
So this is the accordion behavior
that I was talking about.

96
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,190
Let's now quickly look at how we
implement this accordion behavior

97
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,485
using the panel group and the panels.

98
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,360
Going to the source code,
we now see the code for

99
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,680
the accordion shown on the left-side and

100
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,550
the accordion itself as seen on
the web page shown on the right side.

101
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,190
So when you look at the code on the left
side you see that we have enclosed

102
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:52,240
the entire content in an outer div which
has been given the class as panel-group,

103
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,500
and has been given the ID
as accordion there.

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:03,220
And inside there, individual panels
are enclosing the actual content.

105
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,450
So, the individual panels,
as you can see here,

106
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:12,088
has a panel-heading and
the panel-body down below here.

107
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:16,870
In the panel-heading,
you can see that I am using

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,710
the h3 class with the panel title,
and then inside the h3 class,

109
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:28,080
I am including the name
of the corporate leader.

110
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,250
And this name is enclosed inside an a tag

111
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,660
with the role button and
the data-toggle given as collapse.

112
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,920
So, now you can see why
clicking on that link or

113
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,810
corresponding to the corporate
leader opens and

114
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,230
closes that particular
panel content there.

115
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,481
So, the data-toggle and
then the href, obviously,

116
00:08:56,481 --> 00:09:00,488
pointing to the panel itself down below.

117
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:01,347
In addition,

118
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:06,350
I am also giving another data attribute
called data-parent with the accordion.

119
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,880
So, this is declaring
that this panel forms

120
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,410
one of the panels in the panel
group there with the id accordion.

121
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,030
So this is why the data-parent
is given the id as accordion,

122
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,438
which is the id of the panel group there.

123
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:26,780
Now, the content itself is enclosed inside

124
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,120
a panel-collapse class with a collapse and
in here.

125
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,260
Now this means that this
particular content will start out

126
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,930
by being shown on the screen.

127
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,650
So that is why on the right-hand side,
you can see that the CEO's panel

128
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:49,210
starts out as open, but the remaining
panels we will not use the in class for

129
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,480
the remaining panel collapses.

130
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,290
We will only use the collapse class there.

131
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,390
And note also that the ID is given as
Peter, which corresponds to the href

132
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,340
that you gave for the a tag earlier there.

133
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,364
Inside this panel-collapse,

134
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:14,089
we are enclosing the actual content,
the p element that we had,

135
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:20,490
with the description inside a inner div,
with the class panel-body.

136
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,970
So the outer div enables
the collapse behavior to work.

137
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,660
And the inner div actually
contains the panel-body,

138
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,270
which is displayed on
the screen on the right side.

139
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,710
So, when you click on the name
of the corporate leader,

140
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,250
the corresponding panel is
either hidden or revealed.

141
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,630
Because of the enclosing
of all these panels

142
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,360
inside a panel group with
the id accordion, and

143
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,560
the data-parent attribute specified
as accordion for each of the panels.

144
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,930
When you click on any one
of those panel headings,

145
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,576
that particular panel will be revealed and
will also result in the remaining panel

146
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:08,700
bodies being collapsed correspondingly.

147
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,760
So, this is what implements the accordion
behavior that you see on the web page.
