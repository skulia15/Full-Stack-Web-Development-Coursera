1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,980
In the previous exercise we saw the use of
tabbed navigation and tabs and tab page.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,470
Now we're going to convert those tabs into

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:20,880
an accordion using the collapse
class that we just learned about.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,780
In addition, we're going to
make use of the scroll spy and

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,370
affix class that we just
learned in order to introduce

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,690
some side navigation to our
about start HTML pitch.

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,730
Getting back to our web page,

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,840
let's do a little bit of housekeeping
on this web page and creat space so

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,390
that we can introduce the sidebar using
the scroll spy and affix later on.

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,850
We will also convert the tabs and
the tab navigation into accordion now.

11
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,920
So going through this webpage,
you notice that the second and

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,200
the third rows have some empty
space on the right side.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,620
So we're gonna delete that empty space and

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,570
let these two rows stretch
completely the entire screen.

15
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,700
Now, the first row, I'm gonna cut
down the size a little bit, because

16
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,350
when we push the content to the left here
in order to accommodate the skull spy,

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,240
some of these content will look
a little squished on the left side.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,700
So let's do that housekeeping and then
we'll come back and look at the webpage

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,950
before we move on to working
on introducing the Accordion.

20
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,620
Going to your web page content,
I am now going to adjust

21
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,840
the columns specifications for
the first row.

22
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,080
Previously we were using column sm-8.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,340
I'm going to reduce that to column SM6,
but for large screens

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,820
Its fine to keep the eight columns for
the first part of the content.

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,850
So let me update the column classes here I

26
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,710
have updated the column classes to
column SM6 and column LG8 so for

27
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:24,705
the mediums I screened also
The six will still apply.

28
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:31,040
The other part of this row
which contains the panel,

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,560
I have adjusted the column
classes appropriately.

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,670
So I have used column sm-6 and
column lg-4 for this.

31
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,700
The remaining two rows I'm going
to adjust the column class so

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,990
that is occupies the entire 12 columns for
the content,

33
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,640
which also means that I need to
remove the div which was reserved for

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,870
the empty space on the right side.

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,150
For the second column, I have adjusted so
that it occupies the entire 12 rows,

36
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,340
and then I have removed the second
div which was in this particular row.

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,880
Same thing for the third row also.

38
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,240
After making the changes,
looking at the state of the web page

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,450
you notice that the columns have been
adjusted accordingly, the second and

40
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,740
the third row now occupy
the entire 12 columns here.

41
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,580
Now we are going to later on squish these
to the left by introducing a relational

42
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,400
road to nest this content so
that we will create enough space on

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,810
the right side to introduce this
scroll spy and the effects.

44
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,140
In our next step, we're going to go
to these tabs that we created for

45
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,330
the corporate leadership and
then replace that with an accordion.

46
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,536
We're going to make use of the collapse
class that we have learned earlier

47
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:03,820
together with the panel that we have

48
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,150
seen in the previous module and the panel
group, that is a group of panels.

49
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,310
And then we are gonna make use of
that to design the accordion for

50
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,270
the different corporate leadership, here.

51
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:23,780
So, all these tabs will be turned
into accordions using these classes.

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,720
Going back to the code,

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,400
I am now going to remove the tab
navigation that I have introduced earlier.

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,920
So the ul that we introduced for the tab
navigation will be completely removed, and

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,810
then I will start turning each of
those tab panes into panels and

56
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,600
enclose them inside a panel group.

57
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,419
And then apply the appropriate collapse
classes to turn that into an accordion.

58
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:59,325
I have now deleted the tabbed navigation.

59
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:05,305
Now I'm going to take this div and
then turn that into a panel group first.

60
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:15,480
So I have now replaced the tab content
with a div with the class panel group.

61
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,130
So anything inside, all the panels inside
will now form a group of panels and

62
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,220
such that the spacing between
them is adjusted appropriately.

63
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,340
And we can then apply the accordion
to this group of panels here.

64
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,459
In the next step, I'm going to replace
this tab here and turn that into a panel,

65
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:46,320
and then I'll move the name of
the CEO into the panel heading.

66
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,640
Then the panel content,
the P that we had where we described

67
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,600
the content,
will be moved into a panel body.

68
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,830
I have first introduced
that panel there and

69
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,060
then the panel heading,
for the very first panel.

70
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,570
So this first panel will contain
the details about our CEO.

71
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:20,230
So, in this panel, you can notice
that I have the div for the panel and

72
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,940
then after that, I have introduced
the inner div for the panel heading.

73
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,430
So this is the typical
structure that we have seen for

74
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,570
panels, where panel headings earlier.

75
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,590
Now inside that, I am using the h3 class,
which I have turned into a panel title.

76
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,420
So this contains the name of the Cu.

77
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,390
Now in order to turn this panel
title in to a control for

78
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:51,210
the accordion class so
that when you click on the link there or

79
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,660
the name of the CEO there,
then the panel will open and

80
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,120
close so the collapse feature
will be introduced there.

81
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,360
For that, I am introducing an A tag here.

82
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,600
Now inside the A tag, I am applying
the data toggle as collapse and

83
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,820
the data-parent,
I am pointing to the accordion,

84
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,290
which I have introduced earlier,
the panel group whose ID is accordion.

85
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,740
So that's the data parent for it.

86
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,700
And so this completes the setting
up of the panel heading.

87
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,070
Now let's go into the panel
content itself, the panel body.

88
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,900
And then make the changes there, and

89
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,565
then go back and look at what
happened to the web page design.

90
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:45,361
In the next step I have
introduced another dev there

91
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:50,600
with the class panel collapse and
collapse and in.

92
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,010
Which means that this
particular panel will be opened

93
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,470
when the webpage is first rendered.

94
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,490
So whatever content is there inside
will be displayed on the web page

95
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,450
when you first visit the web page.

96
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,350
This panel can be turned on and
off by using the collapse class there.

97
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,490
After making these changes,
let's go back and look at our webpage.

98
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,490
Taking a look at out webpage you
can now see that the content

99
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,970
is enclosed inside a panel here.

100
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,170
Now if you click on the panel heading here

101
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,780
the content will, can be collapsed and
then shown again.

102
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:41,090
So this is the collapse class
coming into action here.

103
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,360
Now we're going to apply the same for

104
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,180
the remaining three
corporate leaders in there.

105
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,640
And then come back and
look at the result on the page.

106
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,310
I have now done the same
change to the second corporate

107
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,350
leader's information there, and
I have applied the panel and

108
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:09,520
the panel heading just like I did before,
and the panel title and the A role there.

109
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,100
Now coming down to the panel body itself,

110
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,010
notice that here I have applied
the classes panel collapse, collapse here.

111
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,440
I then applied the in class here which
means that this particular panel I

112
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,500
want it to start out in the closed mode so
that means that it's not gonna be showed.

113
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,860
A little bit close in this when
the page is first visited.

114
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,080
So going back and
looking at the webpage again,

115
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,610
we'll notice that we've introduced
the second panel into the group there.

116
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,940
Going back to our webpage you can now
see that we have two panels in place.

117
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,346
The first panel is open because
we use the in class for

118
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:55,990
that panel body there.

119
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,830
The second panel is closed at this moment,
but if you click on the second panel,

120
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,700
notice that the accordion
behavior comes into action, here.

121
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,870
So you can click on
the two leader's names,

122
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,958
and then you can see the accordion
behavior coming into action here.

123
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,540
Now, we're gonna complete this for
the remaining two

124
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,070
leaders in this list here and
then come back and look at the webpage.

125
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:34,117
After completing the changes,
going back and looking at the webpage,

126
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:39,352
we now see that the full corporate
leaders information is now-

127
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:44,782
Inside an accordion, so you can
click on any one of the leaders and

128
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:48,679
then you can see
the accordion in action here.

129
00:10:55,375 --> 00:11:00,330
Our next step is to
introduce the Scrollspy.

130
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,570
So to do that, what we're going to
first do is to move this entire

131
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,675
content in this web page to the left and

132
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:16,650
create some space on the right side so
that we can introduce a Scrollspy there.

133
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,130
To do that, we will enclose this
whole content inside a row and

134
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,440
then give that a column
class of ten columns so

135
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,670
that we are left with two columns on
the right side for the Scrollspy.

136
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,970
So let me make the change to the webpage,
and

137
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,770
then we'll come back and
have a look at a change to this page.

138
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,740
To create enough space on the website for
the scrollspy,

139
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,190
I'm going to go into this container and
then include its entire

140
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,880
content into another column there.

141
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,640
So to do that,
let me introduce the code here.

142
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:06,084
So here, I have introduced another row and

143
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:12,698
introduced a column class
with column xs-12 and sm-10.

144
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:19,450
And then the entire content will be
enclosed inside this ten columns here.

145
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,225
After making the changes,
looking at the webpage now

146
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:32,169
we notice that we have created
enough space on the right side for

147
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:39,254
us to introduce a vertical navigation
element there to use as a Scrollspy.

148
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:50,449
To introduce the Scrollspy,
I am going to go into the body and

149
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:56,035
introduce the data target and
the data offset here.

150
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,870
So introducing these two elements there,
so

151
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,552
you can see that I have now modified
the body to say the data-spy,

152
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:12,235
scroll, and data-target,
which is the ID of the Scrollspy that

153
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:16,965
I'm gonna introduce later and
the data-offset is 200 here.

154
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:25,920
To introduce a Scrollspy I come down the
bottom of the page just before the footer.

155
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,010
Inside the row of the container,

156
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,200
I will introduce a nav element,
which is going to act as my Scrollspy.

157
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,870
Let me introduce the code there and
then come back to explain it to you.

158
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:44,090
So coming back here you see that
I have now a nav class remember

159
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:50,280
that the scroll spy works only when
you use it on a nav element there.

160
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,580
So here I have a nav class for
which I have introduced the classes as

161
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,190
hidden access, meaning that this
nav element is going to be hidden

162
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,490
when I am viewing the webpage
on an extra small screen.

163
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,440
So I don't need the scroll
spire on extra small screens.

164
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,770
For small to large screens, this
Scrollspy is going to occupy two columns.

165
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,170
So recall that we just created two
empty columns on the right side, so

166
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,700
that is what I'm going to make use of for
the Scrollspy.

167
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,070
Now the Scrollspy itself is created
using the ul class here, for

168
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,990
which I am Using the nav-pills here,
and the nav-stacked.

169
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,960
So this means that this is a sort of
vertical pills that I am creating here.

170
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,840
Now, to this, I am also introducing
this data-spy affix here.

171
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,910
So to turn that into an affix class there,
and then the data off the top is 400.

172
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,250
You have already seen how
the affix works earlier.

173
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,770
So with this introduction,
the Scrollspy will be in place.

174
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,550
Now in order for the Scrollspy to work,
recall that the links

175
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,391
should be introduced to the elements.

176
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:14,410
So in this web page,
these should be introduced to

177
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:20,120
the rows of the content, here.

178
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,830
So let me go ahead and introduce
the IDs for the three rows there.

179
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,390
And then the last step is to modify our

180
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,030
CSS file to introduce
the affects class there.

181
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,500
Going into the content rows for

182
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,750
that row containing the history I am
going to introduce an ID as history.

183
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,929
The second row would be called
with an ID of corporate.

184
00:15:56,565 --> 00:16:00,537
And the third row will
have an ID of facts.

185
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:11,446
Let's save the file and then we will
go into the mystylestarts CSS file and

186
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:16,020
introduce the affix CSS
styles class there.

187
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,753
In the my style starts CSS
file we go to the bottom and

188
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:23,779
then I will introduce
the affix class here.

189
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:31,835
For this affix class, I am declaring
the top to be 100 pixels, so

190
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:34,170
this is how the affix works.

191
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,115
So, saving the changes,
let's go back and look at our webpage.

192
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:45,445
Returning to our webpage,
we now see that the Scrollspy

193
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:49,385
is available on the right side and
it is also

194
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:55,277
incorporated with
the affix class in place.

195
00:16:55,277 --> 00:17:02,067
So as we scroll up,
the nav moves upwards but at a certain

196
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:08,217
point the Affix class takes over and
then the nav gets fixed at that point.

197
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:13,248
You can also see the ScrollSpy in action,

198
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:16,265
so as we scroll our page,

199
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:21,009
as the contents come up the nav reflects

200
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:27,076
the current content being
viewed on the web page.

201
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:43,150
So you can now see this Scrollspy in
action together with the affix plug in.

202
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:51,310
So as you see that as we scroll back
the nav is moved out of the way.

203
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,230
This completes this exercise.

204
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,790
So, in this exercise, we saw three things.

205
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:03,705
We saw the use of the accordion with the
collapse plug in that we have seen earlier

206
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:11,573
and we saw the use of the Scrollspy and
Affix class.
