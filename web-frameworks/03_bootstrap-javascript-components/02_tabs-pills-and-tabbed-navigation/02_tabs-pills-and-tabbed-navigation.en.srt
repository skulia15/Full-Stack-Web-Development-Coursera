1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,135
We will now talk about the use of tabs,
pills and

2
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:10,100
tabbed navigation to enable
presentation of content to the user.

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,930
Obviously on any website there is a lot of
content that can be presented to the user.

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,580
But if we organize it in a way that
is easy to navigate the content,

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,440
then the visitors may find it more easy
to find the information that they want.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,990
So, tabs and pills allow us to
organize the content appropriately.

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,940
Now, tabs and pills provide
the navigational elements for us.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,720
And then the content itself
is enclosed in tabbed pills,

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,370
as we will see when we
go through this lesson.

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,125
Let's take a look at a simple
example of how we can use tabs and

11
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:53,040
tabbed navigation to organize content.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,920
So in this case we are looking at the
information about the corporate leadership

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,930
of our restaurant.

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:06,185
Now the content which was listed all
together has been organized into tabs

15
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:11,785
indexed by the name of
the corresponding leader here.

16
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:16,287
So using the tabbed navigation
we can easily move between

17
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:20,791
the various descriptions of
the different leaders using

18
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:24,470
the tabbed navigation provided for
us there.

19
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:31,220
This enables the visitors not to be
overwhelmed with a lot of content but

20
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,470
instead see the content presented
in an organized manner.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,780
So as we see, the tab and pills provide
us with the navigation elements

22
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,840
to be able to navigate the content that
is already organized into multiple panes.

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,515
Let's now look at a simple example to
understand how we go about implementing

24
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,500
tabbed navigation on our page.

25
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:07,030
To implement tabbed navigation we're gonna
use a UL with the classes nav nav-tabs.

26
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,170
So this is a nav element, as we see.

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,220
So that's why we use the nav class.

28
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,320
And then the other qualifier
is the nav-tabs class there.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,880
Now within that,
each list item will be presented as a tab.

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,080
So you can see in this code here
the different list items presented

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,400
are laid out on the screen as
tabs seeing the example above.

32
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,390
Each of these tab elements carries a a tag

33
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,740
with an href which we can
use to defer to the tab pane

34
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,850
that we're going to include next
with the actual content of the tab.

35
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,680
Also, one of the list items
will be marked as active.

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,190
This means that that particular
tab will be opened by default when

37
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,080
the user navigates to this
location on the page.

38
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,990
Instead of using the nav tabs class,
we can use the nav pills class.

39
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,360
The nav pills class turns the navigational
elements into a list of items

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,120
and the item marked as active will be

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,270
clearly highlighted on the page there.

42
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,247
So you can see that since I applied
the active class to the first element,

43
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:36,570
the corresponding a tag has been

44
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,970
clearly marked out as
a pill on the script.

45
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,180
But both nav tabs and nav pills provide
exactly the same functionality.

46
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,200
Depending on how you want to design your
user interface, you may choose one or

47
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,750
the other as the approach for
designing your navigational elements.

48
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,337
To the navigational elements,
we can also apply the nav-justified class.

49
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:07,381
When you do that the nav
elements will stretch

50
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:12,692
the entire width of
the parent element there and

51
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:16,941
will occupy a proportional portion of

52
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:22,122
the screen width for these nav elements.

53
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:26,463
Now elements within the nav
class can be disabled by using

54
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:30,812
the disabled class applied
to that particular element.

55
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,162
Pills, in addition,

56
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:38,932
provide you with a way of stacking them
vertically rather than horizontally.

57
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:44,050
Nav tabs are always presented
in a horizontal arrangement.

58
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,000
Nav-pills, on the other hand,
can be either presented horizontally, or

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,927
if you use the nav-stacked
class together with nav-pills

60
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:58,220
then the items will be stacked
vertically on the screen.

61
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,490
We will see the use of nav
pills in the next lesson.

62
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,250
The actual content that

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,360
forms the part of the tab will
be enclosed inside a tab pane.

64
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,530
So you will have a div with
the class tab-pane and

65
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,000
inside that the content will be presented.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,768
Now these tab panes are grouped
together inside an outer

67
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:26,720
div with the class tab-content.

68
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,800
And one of those tab panes will be
designated as the active tab pane,

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,130
which means that the content from that
tab pane will be visible on the screen

70
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,480
when you first reach that tab item there.

71
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,045
Going back to our example
that we presented earlier,

72
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:52,370
let's look at the actual code used for
constructing those nav tabs.

73
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,460
So here I present the UL class that
enables me to construct the nav tabs.

74
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:05,630
And also the tab content itself is
enclosed inside a tab pane there, and

75
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,835
these tab panes are enclosed inside
an outer div with the class tab-content.

76
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,131
One more point to note is that
we need to connect the tabbed

77
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:24,550
navigational elements to the content page.

78
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,780
To do that for each of the tabbed
panes we will give an ID, and

79
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:36,530
the same ID will be used in
the list item in the UL class

80
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,360
to refer to this particular tab there.

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,220
So in this example you can see that I have
used the IDS Peter for this tab pane,

82
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:56,380
and there comes warning list item in
the UL class uses the href to Peter there.

83
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,210
In addition, for the tabbed navigation
elements to work correctly,

84
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,530
they should be given the data attribute
data toggle equal to tab there.

85
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,520
Now we will move on to our next
exercise where we will actually

86
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,660
construct the tabs example
that you saw earlier.

87
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,196
So we're going to go into
the aboutus.html page,

88
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:25,955
we're gonna use tabbed navigation to build
the tab navigational elements there,

89
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:30,727
and then we're gonna organize
the content inside tabbed panes, and

90
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,711
enclose that with a tab content div there.
