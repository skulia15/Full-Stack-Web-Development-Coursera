1
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:07,698
In this exercise, we're gonna
look at tabs and tabs navigation,

2
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:11,500
and how we can make use
of that on our website.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,810
So we'll go back to the website that
we have been working on so far, and

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:24,330
add tab navigation to one part
of about our aboutus.html page.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,640
So let's quickly visit the current
state of the aboutus.html page, and

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,950
identify where we can introduce tabs and
tab navigation.

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,670
Taking a look at the aboutus.html page.

8
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,110
As we scroll down we notice that this

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,020
location where we have the list of
corporate leadership at our restaurant.

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,570
Provides an excellent opportunity for
us to apply tabs and tab navigation.

11
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,120
Now we can use tabs to
separate out the content from

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,970
each of the corporate leadership members.

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,010
And then use tab navigation to
navigate Between the different

14
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,050
profiles of the different members there.

15
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,360
To introduce tab navigation
to the aboutus.html page,

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,450
add the location that we identified,
let's go to the HTML code in brackets.

17
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,840
And scroll down to the location where

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,720
we need to introduce the tabs and
tab navigation.

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Here you can see that I
have already introduced

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,450
the part of the code that is required
to setup the tab navigation.

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,670
So let's go and look at the result
of this on the web page.

22
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,250
And then we'll come back and
examine this code.

23
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,020
Going to the webpage you'll now
notice that just below the corporate

24
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,040
leadership we now have
tab elements in place.

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:15,720
This has been introduced by the code
that we added to the about us HTML page.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,390
In particular notice how
this tab navigation works.

27
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:27,860
So you can click on any one of these tabs
in order to switch between the tabs.

28
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,810
Now, obviously as I
switched between the tabs,

29
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,230
nothing happened, because we haven't
introduced the rest of the code

30
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,790
to enable us to separate
the content into different tabs.

31
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,760
And then when we click on the tabs,

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,980
we should be able to navigate
to the different tabs.

33
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,160
Going back to the source code,
you'll notice that the tab elements there

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,700
have been constructed using the ul class

35
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,400
with the nav and
nav-tabs as their class for

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,350
the ul and of course,
the role that we have given this tablist.

37
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,700
Now, inside this ul,
a list elements specify

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,470
the various tabs that will form
part of this tab navigation.

39
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,850
So let's go in and
look at the individual list elements and

40
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,670
then identify the various parts that
are specified in those list of elements.

41
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,670
So going down we see that the first
list element corresponds to the tab for

42
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,730
the CEO of the company.

43
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,820
In here we specify for the list.

44
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,415
We specify the class as active.

45
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:49,021
Which means that this is the tab
that the users will see when

46
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:53,637
they first navigate down to
that location on the webpage.

47
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:58,608
The remaining tabs will be
hidden behind the scene and

48
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:03,358
they users can navigate to
those tabs by clicking on

49
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:07,568
the tab items in the tab navigation.

50
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:12,808
In addition,
inside the list item we have a a tag

51
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:19,500
which contains the actual
content of the list item there.

52
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,470
So this a tag contains the href that we're
gonna make use of to refer to the specific

53
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,790
tab item, which will be
included as part of this tab.

54
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,200
We'll talk about how we include
the tab content in the next step, but

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,560
you notice that I have already
introduced the link to that tab content.

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,510
So, what is left is for
me to design the tab content and

57
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,270
then specify the appropriate link for
the tab content.

58
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,550
In addition, there are specifying
that the data toggle is a tab, so

59
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,570
this way we know that we are activating
the JavaScript component

60
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,840
that enables support
to the tab navigation.

61
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,730
Looking at the remaining
list items in this

62
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,220
ul here, you'll notice that for
the remaining ones also,

63
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:23,820
the specification is similar in
the a tag you specify the ID

64
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,320
of the tab content element,
that we are going to introduce later.

65
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:38,120
Now that we have constructed
the navigation part of the tabbed design.

66
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,600
Let's look at how we're gonna
take the actual content and

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,260
enclose them inside tabs.

68
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,130
So to do that, let's scroll down and

69
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,050
then we see that we have
the content down below here.

70
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,000
We want to separate this content into four
different tabs, so that when the user

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,300
clicks on one of those tabs then they
user will be able to navigate to that

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,090
specific tab containing the details of the
person selected from the tab navigation.

73
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,390
To divide the content
into multiple tab panes,

74
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,610
the first thing that we do is
to enclose the entire content

75
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,400
into a div with the class tab-content.

76
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,790
Now, then after we will
introduce tab panes,

77
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:32,360
which will contain individual items
that correspond to each of the tabs

78
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,460
that have been identified in the tab
navigation that we have already set up.

79
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,040
We set up the content for
each tab pane by enclosing

80
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,155
the content inside a dev
which is given the class

81
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:54,500
tab-pane as you see in the code there.

82
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,652
Now for this class, aside from tab-pane I
have also specified the fade and the in.

83
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:06,888
fade meaning that when you transition to
this tab, then this tab will fade in,.

84
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:11,618
So we introduce some transitions
into the web page so

85
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:16,241
that when you're navigating
to different parts,

86
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:22,230
the navigation,
the movement looks fluid on the screen.

87
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,138
The in part is to identify that
this tab should be left open

88
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:32,166
when the user first navigates
to this part of the webpage.

89
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:37,003
So in this case, we will have the first
tab corresponding to the CEO always

90
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:41,465
open when the user first navigates
down to this part of the webpage.

91
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:46,312
So subsequently the user can select
the remaining tabs by clicking on the tab

92
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,230
items there.

93
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,570
We are now going to repeat the same for
the remaining content in here.

94
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,820
After we complete that, then we'll go and
look at the new state of the pitch.

95
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,120
After enclosing all
the content respectively

96
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,040
into their respective tab page, Let's
go and look at the resulting webpage.

97
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,550
Moving back to our webpage,

98
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,230
you now notice that the content has
been neatly organized into tabs there.

99
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,340
We have now separated each of
the content into the individual dibs

100
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,260
with the class tab page.

101
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,610
And attached them appropriately to the tab

102
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:41,060
navigation elements that are part of the
tab navigation that we already introduced.

103
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,438
No when we'll click on the are tabs,

104
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:52,275
the content will appropriately switch
to show the corresponding content.

105
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:57,105
Now, for each of these tab pages,
we have appropriately set up the IDs so

106
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:00,345
that the links that have
been introduced for

107
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:05,875
these tab- navigation image
there will work correctly.

108
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:15,310
One last minor change that we
would like to introduce here

109
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,540
is to enclose this content inside a pane

110
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,050
with actual borders to introduce the pane
so that it looks like a real tab here.

111
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,078
I'm going to go in and
introduce some minor changes

112
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:39,074
to the tab content element
what we have described.

113
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:46,129
To introduce borders for
the tab content I'm

114
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:50,340
gonna go into the mystyles.html page and

115
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:57,250
set up the appropriate code for
the tab content page there.

116
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,310
So looking at the code here, you'll see
that I have set up the CSS class for

117
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,440
the tab content to include
borders on the left, right,

118
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,290
and the bottom of the tab content
with a padding of ten pixels.

119
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,070
Now this will complete the look and
feel of the tab content,

120
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,610
such that it looks really like tabs there.

121
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,720
Going back to our webpage,
you now notice that the content of the tab

122
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,940
panes are now enclosed neatly
inside bolded tabs and

123
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,770
they have connected themselves to the tab
navigation elements appropriately.

124
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,700
So that it looks like a real tab.

125
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,040
So when you navigate
to the different tabs.

126
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,810
You do notice a nice, clean interface
being delivered for these tabs there.

127
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,430
This completes the exercise on using tabs.

128
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,740
So in this exercise, we examined tabs and
tab navigation, and how we can,

129
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,230
put content into tab panes, and then
appropriately associated those tab panes.

130
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:14,980
With the tab navigation elements, so
that the navigation works correctly.

131
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,770
Now, obviously as we have stated earlier,
for the tab navigation to work,

132
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:27,622
you need JavaScript component to
be included into your web page.

133
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:31,180
We have already included
the bootstrap.min.js file there.

134
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:39,250
So that's why this JavaScript plugin
is already included into our webpage.
