00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,858
[SOUND] Let us now see how we can set up

2
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:09,706
Node.js and NPM on our computer.

3
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:16,210
First, go to nodejs.org, and then, on the
webpage you will see a download button.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:22,780
Click on the download button to download
the Node.js installer to your computer.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,330
Once you have downloaded,

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,084
then double-click on the installer to
start installing Node.js on your machine.

7
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:35,530
I have double-clicked on
the Node.js installer on my Mac and

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,750
then I see this installer window open up.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,020
If you are using Windows or

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,440
Linux, you might see a slightly
different configuration of the window.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,270
You can go ahead and

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,430
continue the installation following
the instructions on the screen.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,915
Once you have completed the installation
then you can close the installed window.

14
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:02,370
Once you complete the installation,

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,040
in order to verify the node has been
correctly installed on your machine,

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,720
open up a terminal window if
you're using a Mac or Linux, or

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,580
the command window or
the PowerShell if you're using Windows.

18
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,240
At the prompt, type in node -V to

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,130
check the version of node that has
been installed on your machine.

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,920
Similarly, you can type in npm
-v to check the version of

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,440
npm that has been
installed on your machine.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,920
If both of these work correctly, and
the version number is indicated,

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,019
then your machine is all set up and
ready to use Node.js.
