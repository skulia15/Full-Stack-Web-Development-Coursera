1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,900
Our next exercise examines
the use of Bootstrap and

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,790
JQuery together in particular,
using the Bootstrap's JavaScript

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,650
methods in order to control some of
the JavaScript components in Bootstrap.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,210
In this exercise, we're gonna introduce a
couple of buttons to control the carousel.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,550
We'll be able to start and

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,760
stop the slide transitions in
the carousel using these buttons.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,283
These buttons will be activated using
Bootstrap's JS component methods.

8
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:42,760
You can see the slide transitions
in the index.html page.

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,360
Now, you see that we have introduced
two buttons at the right corner of

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,910
the carousel, which allow us to
control the slide transitions.

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,880
We can pause the slide transitions so

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,930
that the transitions
are completely paused.

13
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:08,750
We can then resume the slide transitions
by clicking on the Resume button there.

14
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,222
Now these two buttons
are gonna be introduced using

15
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:15,379
the Bootstrap's JavaScript paste methods.

16
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:20,900
How do we introduce these controls?

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,500
We'll go to the index.html page, and

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,640
inside the carousel we will introduce
the two buttons as a button group.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,320
Let me add the code, and
then we'll come back and review this.

20
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,073
You can now see that I have introduced
a button group here with the ID

21
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:43,681
"carouselButtons" and
this contains two buttons in there.

22
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:49,180
There are two buttons,
the first one containing

23
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,490
the pause glyphicon, inside there.

24
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:01,210
And the second button here,
having the play glyphicon inside there.

25
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,700
So these two buttons get
added to the carousel.

26
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,084
To position the carousel
control buttons correctly,

27
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:17,206
I have added a CSS class here for
the carousel buttons.

28
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:20,528
This CSS class gives the right and

29
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:26,290
bottom to 0 pixels and
the position as absolute.

30
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,150
This will move the button group to
the bottom right corner of the carousel.

31
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,450
Our final modification to
the index.html page is to add

32
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,660
the JavaScript code to
the end of the page,

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,690
just before the end of the body tag.

34
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,207
So here, you can see that I have
pasted the JavaScript code here with

35
00:02:54,207 --> 00:03:00,020
the $(document).ready(function(){
driving this code here.

36
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,106
So, inside there,
the first thing that I have done

37
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:11,613
is to set the transition interval
to two seconds by specifying for

38
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:15,887
the mycarousel the interval as 2000.

39
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:21,239
I have also introduced two new functions
here, corresponding to the pause and

40
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,482
the play button that we have
just introduced in the carousel.

41
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:31,415
For the Pause button, you can see that
I am, when the Pause button is clicked,

42
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:38,565
the carousel is going to be paused by
calling the .carousel('pause'); method.

43
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:42,705
Similarly, when the Play
button is clicked,

44
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:47,386
the .carousel('cycle'); method is called.

45
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:55,910
With these changes, the two control
buttons for the carousel are now active.

46
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,910
So we can now pause the slide transitions,

47
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,160
as well as resume the slide transitions
by clicking the two buttons there.

48
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,590
So again, going back to the web page,

49
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,080
you can see that I can pause the
transitions by clicking the Pause button,

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,810
and so the transitions
are completely paused at this point.

51
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,690
I can always resume transitions
by clicking the Resume

52
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,510
button which resumes the transitions
of the slides in the carousel.

53
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,835
This completes this exercise.

54
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:39,479
In this exercise we have examined
the use of JavaScript-based controls for

55
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,399
the Bootstrap Carousel JS component.
