1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,100
Building websites involves
a lot of tedious work.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,610
Even with the simple website
that we have been building so

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,650
far, you realized that you had
to do a lot of work manually.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,430
For example, we had to go and
fetch Bootstrap and all the files related

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,470
to Bootstrap by going to the website and
then downloading all the stuff from there.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,270
Then we had to go and fetch and

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:34,110
many other assets that we require for
building of our website.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,770
Now, if we need to
repetitively do these things,

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,870
it becomes extremely cumbersome
after a period of time.

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,830
This is where if we have automation
tools that can help us to

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:54,449
quickly accomplish these tasks with a few
commands it would be really beneficial.

12
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,530
The note came onto the scene,
bringing together the JavaScript run time.

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,340
The web developers suddenly realized that
they could easily use the JavaScript

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,440
skills that they already possess to write
a whole bunch of tools that help to

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,660
automate a lot of the tasks that
they do day in and day out.

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,630
This is spawned a rich
set of tools that have

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,070
become widely adopted by
the web development community.

18
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,210
Now we are going to review
a few of these wonderful tools.

19
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,350
To help us to manage our
own web development.

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,267
As I mentioned, there are a lot of
tools for doing the development.

21
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:48,440
We can do review a few of them
that will prove very essential

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,750
as you go through the remaining
courses of this specialization.

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,760
We will learn these tools just in time and
then start immediately applying them

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,950
for helping us to progress in the courses.

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,680
First we will learn about Bower,
which is a package manager for the Web.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,250
Then, in the next course,
we will learn about Grunt and

27
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,580
Gulp, which are what we
call task automation tools.

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,810
Then we'll look at Yo,
which is a web app scaffolding tool.

29
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:32,400
Now, all these tools have been brought
together under this umbrella called

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,850
Yeoman, which is a workflow that is
designed around and using these tools.

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,020
We are going to learn more about
Yeoman in the next course,

32
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,610
but at this moment we are just going
to learn specifically about power

33
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,760
which is one of the components
in this tool set.

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,852
Now if you have been doing programming
using one of the integrated

35
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:04,830
development like Visual Studio, Reclipse,
and so on you see that there is a lot of

36
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,550
integration of tools that help
you to get your web accomplished.

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,070
In the web world, we don't have a single
integrated development environment.

38
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,940
The web developers generally prefer
to use a lot of command line tools.

39
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,037
So the tools that you're going to
encounter Power, Grunt, Gulp, and Yo,

40
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:33,000
and Yeoman, are all command line tools
that we gonna execute using a terminal.

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,930
And all these are built in JavaScript,
and they are run using note.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,210
Right now, we are going to
explore Bower in more detail.

43
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,060
Bower, as I mentioned,
is a package manager for the web.

44
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,880
Now what does this mean?

45
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,620
When you build a website,
we realize that we need to fetch a lot of

46
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,740
packages that we need
in building our tool.

47
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,760
As an example, when we were building
our website through the exercises.

48
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,400
We saw that we went to
the Bootstrap website and

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,680
fetched the Bootstrap files.

50
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,150
Then we ventured to
Font Awesome website and

51
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,720
fetched all the Font Awesome files and
so on.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,390
So, we had to manually
do all these things.

53
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,090
Now, Bower automates the search for
all these web packages,

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,120
as you will see when we go
through the exercise next.

55
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:44,510
Bower helps us to automatically
fetch all these components.

56
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:50,980
Not only that, we will notice that if
we need to reinstall the components,

57
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,780
or update this components,
Bower comes to our rescue, okay?

58
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,720
Now, Bower is one of the tools
in the whole tool set

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,290
which forms part of our workflow.

60
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,640
So as we go through,
we will learn the remaining tools and

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,500
then imply them to get our work done.

62
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,940
The best way to learn more about
Bower is actually to use it.

63
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,580
In the process we will learn all
the commands that we need to understand

64
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,960
to employ Bower to get our work done.

65
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,390
So in the next exercise we're gonna make
use of Bower to automatically go and

66
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,340
fetch for us Bootstrap, Font Awesome from

67
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,980
the available packages, web packages.

68
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,156
And then we'll make use of
them in building our website.
