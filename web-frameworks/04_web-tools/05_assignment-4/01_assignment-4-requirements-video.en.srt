1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,320
In this assignment,
you're gonna explore the use of

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,650
the JavaScript methods in
order to control the models.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,867
Earlier when we implemented the models,
we used the data attributes in

4
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:18,042
order to trigger the showing and
hiding of the model.

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:21,673
We can replace that with
JavaScript methods for

6
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:25,950
the model that enables us to show and
hide their models.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,860
Going to the web page, now,
when you click on the Log in button,

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,480
you're gonna see the Log in model
being displayed on the screen.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,313
Similarly, when you click
on the Result button,

10
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:46,070
you'll still see the Reserve Table
model being shown on the screen there.

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,615
Now, both of these now are triggered
using the JavaScript methods

12
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,386
rather than using the data attributes.

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,829
So in this assignment, you're gonna
remove the data attributes that you were

14
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,490
using to trigger the models, and instead,
replace them with JavaScript methods
