00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:06,932
As we come to the conclusion of
this course, I hope that you

2
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:12,360
had a good time going through
the materials in this course.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,230
I hope you have gotten a good grasp
of Bootstrap and its capabilities.

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,710
So in this course, we examined
Bootstrap in sufficient detail,

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,050
we looked at responsive web design and

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:35,480
the use of Bootstrap Grid System
to construct responsive websites.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,280
We also looked at Bootstrap CSS and
JavaScript components.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,530
Finally, we looked at Web Tools.

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,371
We looked at Node.js and NPM, and Bower.

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,670
As we conclude this course and move onto
the next course where we will look at

11
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,380
JavaScript based frameworks,
in particular AngularJS in more detail.

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,470
I hope to see you around
in the next course.
